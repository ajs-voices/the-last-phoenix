# Restless Nights

Walker took the paper from me and saw the contact information and the times.  He asked me, "Why did you want the times and dates?"

"We can use it to pinpoint events that coincide.  See what else The Dragon is up to other than robbing banks."

"That's a wide birth of things to cover."  Walker frowned.

"That's what Scrin are for.  We'll drop it off with Dae'lin and let them do their job.  They'll have something for us in the morning.  I have a birthday to finish celebrating."  I smiled at him.

"Sorry, I made you work on the one day off we get."  Walker said, "Why don't you let me buy you a drink."

"I have a date with a little dragon and some cake.  You can join me." I offered.

"I'll let you do your thing.  I still don't know why you care so much about all these supernaturals.  But hey whatever gets you off."  Walker held the door for me as we walked into the AU building for the last time today.  "I'll see you first thing tomorrow, Nox."

"I'll see you at 10:30.  I have an appointment at 9:30, I won't miss."  Therapy was that important.  I did not miss it - ever.

Walker nodded and headed for the elevator.  I joined him and he smiled.  "You don't have to be brave for me."  He joked.

I couldn't help but smile at the jab he was taking.  "I told you I got a hot date."

"Cake and dragon.  I remember."

Several people got on with us and when we reached HQ, Walker got off.  "I'll take this to Dae'lin.  Enjoy your night."

I nodded my thanks and got off on the Academy floor with a few other parents.  It was an odd feeling thinking I was a parent.  I didn't feel any different from before.  It was then I remembered I had a dinner date with Treec on Monday.  Great.  More dealing with people when I'd rather be talking and hanging with Sage.  I don't know why he was top of my mind but his bright blue eyes were never far from my thoughts.

I waited with the other toddler aged parents in the waiting room.  Each kid running to their parent or parents with arms wide open and smiles.  It made me wince when a small hand reached up and took mine.  I looked down to see Drake curling his fingers around my index finger.  "Hey little man.  You snuck up on me."

He grinned up and nodded.  "Nox."  A woman called from behind me and I turned around.  

"Yes, ma'am?"  I didn't recognize the woman, but she knew me well enough to call me by my first name.

"I'm Lita.  Drake's teacher.  I understand you adopted him.  I need to let you know he's already sparked. We've had a few fires today, and he seems to have mastered veiling already.  He enjoys hide and seek."

I grinned and offered Lita my hand.  "I will keep that in mind.  And we'll have a talk tonight about when veils are appropriate and when they aren't."

Lita frowned, "We will have to assign him a fire-starter teacher soon."

"Does it have to be official?  He's not Venatori.  I can train him to control his gift."

Lita nodded, "He'll need an official teacher.  However, since I know your history, I think if you can get him to control his gift without a fire-starter teacher in say a week or two, I will refrain from the recommendation."

"You'd do that for me?"  I asked.

She smiled.  "You were the youngest Cesari.  Everyone knows there is dragon blood in Cesari.  So who better to teach him than you - he will probably be closest to Cesari, anyway."

I nodded.  "I get two weeks?"

She nodded. "I'll give you two weeks.  And if you have luck with him, I might need you to teach a whole class of would be fire-starters."

"You have a class full of them?"  I asked.

"Potentially.  They are showing signs."  She smiled at me and waved at Drake. "You take care of Nox now.  He's a special person.  And he's afraid of many things."

I grinned at her analysis of me and laughed when she stuck her tongue out.  She giggled, "Treec says you have a date?"

I smiled.  "You are friends with Treec?"

She nodded, and I returned the affirmative.  "Yeah."

Lita asked, "It's not a pity date is it?"

I shook my head.  "For her or for me?"

Lita laughed, "She might pity you.  We all do."  She stuck her tongue out at me again.  "Don't hurt her."

I sighed, "Lita, I'm not looking for a mate, just a mother for my children.  If she wants more I'm not that man.  I got my eyes on someone else for the role of life partner."

"Oh really?  Why isn't she your baby mama then?"  She asked almost playfully but I could hear the disdain in her voice.

"Because he can't have babies anymore than I can." 
Lita blushed at my response. "Good luck with that.  Just be honest with Treec.  I won't hurt you if you do that."
I grinned, "Deal."  I looked down at Drake and smiled.  "You ready to go home?"

Drake nodded and pulled me towards the door. 

I followed dutifully behind the little dragon and when we went for the elevator I happily followed him.  Before the doors closed, I picked up the boy and held him on my hip as I leaned against the glass wall trying my best not to freak out in front of him.  "I went by your old house and picked up a few things.  They are waiting back in my apartment."

Drake lit up.  "Snoopy?  Blankie?"

I grinned and nuzzled his cheek, "Yeah, I think I got them both."

He wrapped his arms around my neck and squeezed.  "Tank you."

"You are welcome buddy."  I hugged the little dragon and couldn't help the deep breath I took with him so close.  I chuckled to myself as I noticed Drake doing the same thing.  The scent of safety seemed to be a common thing.  The little boy smelled of burning sugar - caramel would be the best description but it wasn't quite it either.  

I carried Drake down the hall to my room and unlocked the door with the little dragon.  Footsteps fell behind me and a giggle from a baby which wasn't in my arms turned my attention to find Mia and Naya standing there watching me do my balancing act.  Mia grinned.  "See, I told you, you'd be a natural."

"Not yet anyway.  But I'm learning."  I opened the door and let Mia enter before me.  I set Drake down on the floor and motioned to his bag on the couch.  "Go see if I got what you wanted.  I can go back again if you need me too."

Drake smiled and drug the bag from the couch and sat on the floor between the coffee table and the couch.  Mia grinned and set down a small box on my counter and handed me a bag.  "Jace would have brought them by but he's stuck with a kid after school.  Parents are late. One's your birthday present, the other is a welcome to parenthood present."

"Is that a rumor now?"  I asked.

Mia shook her head.  "No.  Dorian told Jace.  And I bought the present downstairs, figuring you'd need it."  She gave me a kiss on the cheek and held Naya up to get her own kiss from me.  "We need to get home.  We'll check in on you tomorrow after your first night.  Good luck, Nox."  She called out to Drake.  "We'll see you again soon, Drake.  Soon you and Nox will come stay with us."

Drake waved, but he was he pulled things out of his bag tossing them behind him.  I took a deep breath and let it go for the moment.  I distracted myself from the mess by opening the birthday present first.  

Comic strips wrapped around the box as per Jace's tradition.  His main goal in life was making me laugh when I was a kid.  This had done the job on many birthdays.  I removed the tape so I could read them later without having to decipher the text.  Inside the box was a coffee mug with different lines measuring out when was safe to talk to me.  I set it down on the counter with a wry grin.  Jace bought me the same mug last year and the year before that.  He either forgot what he bought me or he was being lazy.  Both seemed plausible.

The other present was a book wrapped in only a ribbon.  It was an old edition of Grimm's Fairy Tales.  Not age appropriate, but considering what Drake and I were it was spot on.  I didn't have books appropriate for children in my apartment.  Drake caught eye of the book and was hopping up and down at my feet.  "Read?"

I smiled and picked him up.  "Let's clean up the mess first, take a bath and get ready for bed and then we'll read.  But I think we have cake to eat first.  And then dinner.  Okay?"

Drake nodded at me with wide eyes.  Cake before dinner was impressive.

I opened the box Mia placed on my counter.  It was the same thing she ordered for me every year.  A chocolate cake with cream cheese frosting and an orange balloon drawn on top.  It was simple and sweet and the only time I ate cake.

I cut the small cake into fourths and set one on a napkin for Drake to eat.  Then lifted the little man to the bar stool and pushed him in.  Cake wasn't complete without a glass of milk.  I poured two and Drake looked at me with concern.  "Wrong cup?"

"Messy."

I smiled.  "A straw work?  It's all I got."

Drake nodded.  The straws were kept for strange occasions all revolving around Jace visiting.  I plopped a bendy rainbow straw into Drake's milk and he grinned before he took a long sip of the cold milk.  I'd have to buy some plastic cups with straws to make life easier.  I didn't want Drake to break the few glasses I had, or to hurt himself when he dropped them.

We ate cake and drank our milk while I pulled out the makings of dinner.  Drake watched with big orange eyes and frowned at the vegetables on the counter.  "Hey. You had cake first, least you can do is try them."

He frowned, but he nodded his acceptance of the situation.  This might be harder than it looked.  Drake had finished his cake and the glass of milk was empty.  "Can you clean up the clothes mess you made?  Put them back in the bag?  Please?"

Drake nodded.  "Yes, sir."  I helped the little one down and he scurried around the couch to pick things up.

I cooked and Drake finished with his clothes - I hoped by the time I finished making a small plate of salad with grilled chicken and a homemade dressing on it.  I hoped the apples and grapes would make it more fun for him to eat, but I didn't have high hopes.  

I'd been wrong as Drake finished his food and a glass of water.  It wasn't late.  I'd eaten sooner than I'd planned, and there was little else to do in my studio apartment.  Drake was playing with Snoopy and a few matchbox cars he'd found in his bag.  The cars were driving over the glass coffee table and the magazines on top of it.  I watched him for a while before he sat down in my lap and curled up.  "Tired."

I smiled.  "I don't have a bathtub.  The sink might be too small."  We had a dilemma.  I grabbed a pair of swim trunks from my drawer and a change of clothes for Drake. The easiest way was to just jump in with him and get wet.

Drake thought it was funny when I stepped into the shower with the colorful swim trunks on.  The water was warm, and I sat down against the wall once the water was warm enough and let Drake dance in the rain of the shower head.  We washed and rinsed and splashed.  I was grateful the shower door and walls went from floor to ceiling or we'd probably have had a big mess by the time we were done.

Drake was yawning, and it was making me sleepy.  It was still way to early for me to sleep but Drake was curling up in my arms as I carried him to bed.  I laid down in my favorite spot near the middle of the bed and set Drake down on the wall side and he curled up on the pillow and blinked at me as I got up to grab the book.

I laid back down with my phone and Drake looked up at it with a smile.  I flipped the camera on and took a sleepy selfie of Drake curled up against my shoulder.  I texted the picture to Sage.

> Me  
> 646-555-4512  
> Sun, 06/24/2015  
> ****  
> Me and a little dragon.  Drake says hi.  
> 08:14 PM  

I set the phone down next to my head and pulled the book up so Drake could see the words.  I started to read, "In olden times, when wishing still did some good, there lived a king whose daughters were all beautiful..." 

My phone rang with a new Skype call.  I was concerned since I hadn't installed it, or created an account but it was Skype on my phone.  I saw the name of the call and grinned and answered it with a big grin, "Did you hack my phone?"

Sage laughed.  "No, I borrowed it when you weren't looking."

"You picked my pocket then?"  

Sage grinned at me lying in his own bed.  "It wasn't hard."

"I'm sure not, with you grabbing my ass all the time."

Sage snorted.  "I want to meet Drake?  Can I?"

I nodded.  "Sure.  I pointed the phone at Drake and smiled.  "Drake, I'd like you to meet my boyfriend, Sage.  Sage this is Drake.  He's gonna be staying with me a while."

Drake blinked up at the phone with a smile.  "Pweasure to meet you.  Nox was weading a story.  You want to wisten?"

"I'd love to listen."  Sage said with great pleasure.

I propped the phone up on the other side of Drake so Sage could see us both and I could see him and still read.  And I started again from the beginning with The Frog King.

I finished the Frog King and read Cat and Mouse in Partnership and finished with Mary's Child before Drake's eyes closed and his breathing deepened into sleep.  He'd since abandoned my shoulder and was curled around a pillow - my pillow, but that was alright, I had more.  No reason he couldn't have that one.  They weren't all identical, but I'd buy a replacement.  I knew scent was a big safety net for myself and I wouldn't deprive Drake of it either.

I reached across him and grabbed my phone and pulled the blankets up over his shoulder and crawled out of bed.  I flipped off the lights and went into the bathroom and sat down on the floor near the sink and smiled at Sage in the bright lights of my bathroom.  Sage laughed at me, "Already sneaking away from the kids."

"I didn't want to wake him up, but I wasn't ready to hang up with you either."  I smiled at him.

Sage was still chuckling at me, but he was being quiet about it.  "You called me your boyfriend."

I shrugged.  "Lack of a better word. It fits."

"Boyfriend implies that there is more than just a hook up in mind."  Sage teased.

"Yeah and?"  I smiled at him wanting to stick my tongue out at him but I didn't.  

"I've never liked those terms.  I prefer partner or lover or something more generic and grown up."  Sage was serious, but he was making fun of me too.

"We aren't lovers yet and I don't feel comfortable with partners since Walker is my partner right now."  I grinned at him.

"I see your dilemma.  I suppose boyfriend will do."  He frowned.

"I will refrain from calling you my boyfriend too much."  I said sweetly.

"Thanks.  You have a good day?" Sage asked.

"I had chocolate cake to start dinner and we'll finish it for breakfast."

"You had cake?  For dinner?"  Sage laughed.

"Before dinner.  I think it impressed Drake.  Though it set a bad precedent."  I frowned.

"How's the job going?"  I asked.

"Too busy.  Really annoying.  My brain is fried."

I wanted to see Sage, but I didn't have much to say, thankfully Sage gave me a run down on the unclassified jobs he was working.  Apparently he had classified ones too he was not at liberty to discuss.

Sage was regaling the tale of his current job when there was a knock on front door.  "One sec, Sage.  Someone's at my door I don't want them to wake Drake."

I got up with my phone held to my chest and I heard Sage chuckling on the other side.  I opened the door quietly and looked through the crack and smiled.  "It's Dorian."

Dorian looked at me with a concerned look.  I turned the phone around and showed him who I was talking to.  "Drake's sleeping."  I made sure the door was unlocked as I slipped into the hall way to talk to Dorian.

He handed me an envelope.  "Official paperwork and a birthday present," Dorian said.

"Thanks."  I opened the envelope to see the final documents and the pay increase for adopting a child.  It didn't raise my residency rate, but that's okay I'd build a loft above my bed for Drake when he was stable enough to climb the ladder by himself at night.  Or I could move up into the loft myself.  We'd see.

Inside the same envelope was a ring.  I pulled it out and Dorian explained its meaning.  "His mother wanted him to have it.  It's a family heirloom.  To be passed down to his life mate.  She won't be able to give it to him, so she asked that you do it."

"All right.  But I don't have any place safe to keep it."  I said.

Sage spoke up from the other end.  "We can get you a safe deposit box at the bank downstairs."

Dorian nodded.  "I can hold on to it for you.  When you can get that box downstairs you can put it in there.  I know it's not something you can do until this Dragon thing is taken care of though."

I sighed.  "It's much more than a dragon thing now I think.  But right now we are dealing with the dragons."

Sage asked, "The wolves too?"

I nodded but Sage was still pointed at Dorian on the phone.  I turned it as I spoke, "And the vampires too.  It's bigger than we know."

Dorian nodded.  "Be careful, Nox.  War will happen regardless of your actions, possibly because of your actions."

"I know.  I'll be careful."

Dorian smiled. "I know you will. I will let you get back inside.  Have a good night, Nox.  If you need help with the boy, let me know.  I have experience with wayward sons."

I grinned.  "Thanks, Dorian.  I will.  Night."

Dorian waved at Sage on the phone, "Night, Sage.  Don't keep him up too long."

Sage chuckled, "I won't, sir."

Dorian laughed.  "I hope he rubs off on you."

I stuck my tongue out at Dorian.  He laughed as he walked down the hallway towards his room.  He wasn't too far away, but he had a much bigger apartment.  He was older and held more status despite not completing his fathering duty.

I opened the door and shut it behind me and sat down at the bar in the darkness of my apartment while Drake slept.

"I should go to bed.  I don't want to wake him up and I'll be back up soon, anyway."  I sighed.

Sage frowned at me through the phone.  "Call me if you wake up, Nox."

"I don't want to wake you up."

Sage adjusted the phone and whispered, "Please.  I ask that you call me.  I can't be there to help, so let me at least help calm you down.  Please."

I frowned.  "It'll be 4am."

Sage smiled, "I know and I'm okay with that.  You aren't alone.  I want to help you."

"All right," I agreed.  "I will call you when I wake from my nightmares."

Sage smiled.  "Good.  I will hope not to hear from you, but I know I will."

"Night, Sage."  I blew him a kiss, and he laughed but returned the gesture.  I hung up the video call and put my phone on the counter to charge for the night.

I changed then crawled into bed grabbing a pillow from across the bed and closed my eyes.  I thought of Sage's blue eyes, the scent of jasmine and lavender but the only thing I could smell was burnt cookies which made me smile as I placed my hand on top of the little dragon's head and ran my fingers through his hair.  This wasn't going to be easy, but I was looking forward to it.

Sleep came and so did the dreams.  It wasn't just dreams of the blue eyed monster, there were red and orange.  The first strike landed against my back and I felt the sting in the real world and my eyes shot open.  

I wove air, earth, fire and water and fed it to the new scar that would form.  I could feel the skin knitting together and I grimaced in pain.  It wasn't that it hurt, but it was unnatural.

I got up out of bed and got a drink of water before glancing at my phone.  It was 3am.  I'd woken before time.  I remembered my promise but while I had a moment, I set a new ring tone and text alert for Sage's number.  Then I hit call and waited for the other man to answer.

It was the fourth ring before Sage picked up groggily, "Nox?  You okay?"

I nodded. "Yeah.  Didn't get through the sequence of the dream tonight.  I woke up on the first lash."

I heard Sage sit up.  "You hurt yourself?"

"Skin  broke.  I healed it, no new scar will be there."

Sage sighed. "Except the emotional one."

I laughed into the phone.  "I think those will be there even if I wasn't hurting myself in my sleep.  I'm okay though, really."

"I know you are.  You feel better?"

I smiled.  "Yes.  I like talking to you."  I sighed.  "Raising a kid will throw a kink in my schedule."

"What would you be doing now?"  Sage asked.

"I would go for a run.  Or lift weights.  I could do yoga or bodyweight in the living room." 

"You are a health nut, aren't you?" Sage teased. 

"I am. I'll do that then make breakfast early I guess."

"What time is breakfast?"

I chuckled. "6?"

"I can make that and still get to work on time." Sage said.

"Then I will see you at 6."

"Six then.  I'm going to bed again.  You get all sweaty and chef-like and I'll see you soon. Night, Nox."

I smiled.  "Night, love."

I heard Sage chuckling as I hung up the phone. 

I sat down on the floor and began the breathing exercises in child pose that started off my morning yoga.  It was good to de-stress and detox.  I should have done this last night.  But it's to late for that now.

I moved on to my hands and knees and took a deep breath and lifted my chest and rear into cow pose I let out the breath and tucked my chin into my chest and rounded my back into cat pose.  I could feel the stretch in my back.  

My routine was always the same.  I found something that worked to remove the nightmares from my system.  Table top to downward dog into knee to nose pose.  Downward dog into flip your dog and then to a side plank and returning to downward dog to begin a regular plank.  I minded my breathing, focusing on nothing more than my body working through each pose.  

It cleared my mind as it stretched my body.  Plank lowered into four-limb staff pose.  Upward-facing dog was next and I could feel the stretch again in my legs and back.  Returning to downward facing dog.

Breathe in.  Breathe out.  I stretched though more poses and returned to child pose to begin again for a second and third time before my body felt cleanses of the nightmares.  I rolled over on to my back and stretched out on the floor and stared up at the dark ceiling.  I would have to rearrange my schedule to get everything in.  I wasn't looking forward to the change.  But I needed to go for a run as much as I needed to lift weights, and practice yoga.  It was part of the regime that had kept me sane for the past 10 years or more.  It was important.  I needed it and with a child and more on the way - I needed it more than ever.  Children were anything but predictable.

I checked the time on my phone and I still had plenty of time to shower and cook breakfast before Sage would arrive at 6.  I sat up and looked across the room at the sleeping form of the little dragon in my bed.  A loft would work for him even now.  We'd just have to put on a rail so he didn't fall out unexpectedly.  I made mental sketch of things and I would see if I could have it built sooner rather than later.  

I didn't turn on the bathroom light as I opened the bathroom door, I could shower just as easily in the dark and that's what I did.  The water was hot against my skin and spot that should have been tender under the heat wasn't.  It had healed near completion.  

I spent 30 minutes in the shower devoid of any thought but the warmth of the water and the desire for Sage's arms to be wrapped around me.  I don't know why I'd fallen so hard for the man with the blue eyes.  He wasn't the most gorgeous man I'd seen.  He wasn't the funniest or even the smartest.  But his smile drew me in.  His sapphire blue eyes said I was home.  I knew that was my brain speaking more than finding these things true.  I knew I formed attachments quickly when I chose to let someone in.

Jace and I had been distant friends until his mother made us play together.  We weren't friends, we were just roommates.  But when I agreed to let him in he was my best friend.  My only friend for a long time.  Jason Hill was like a brother and it had been just as instantaneous as it was with Sage.  Except this time, Sage was not just a friend.  

If I'd been older when I connected with Jace things would have moved into the sphere Jace had wanted it to for so long.  But change is difficult and losing my best friend and brother is the worst possible thing for me to imagine.  Jace made me sane.  He was part of the whole piece of who I'd become.  

If I'd lost him in a bad break up, then I'd have been lost.  I love my best friend but not in the manner he had wished it.  I was thankful when he fell in love with Mia.  Mia is my savior in that sense.  It's still a touchy situation, but most of the time Jace and I are fine in our relationship.

I was growing too connected to the blue eyed boy who intrigued me from the start.  It had taken me a while to remember the night I'd first met him.  When I was dancing and screwing his friend.  I had liked him then, his big blue eyes, his sweet smile.  I had liked that he watched me over his friend.  I was the center of his attention that night and I had thrived on it.  Maybe in my subconscious I knew who he'd been when I'd hit on him.  Maybe it was why I hit on Sage at the club when Dr. Silas was bothering me.  All I know is that I wanted more than I had with him, and I was willing to work for it.  Margo would be proud of me.  Hell, I was proud of me.  Maybe I was growing up.

I was quiet while I got dressed. I pulled on a pair of boxers and a pair of black coated jeans with a black t-shirt that said 'normal people scare me'.  I pulled on my gray hoodie and socks and started making breakfast.

A sun-dried tomato, mozzarella and basil frittata was on tap for the day and I added some Italian sausage to the mix since I was cooking for three - two and a half, I doubted Drake would eat a full persons worth at his age.  But I had never fed a baby dragon before.

I hated adding carbs to my breakfast, but I still had a half the loaf Mrs. Sheila gave me and figured it would make a great toast.  I could roll with some changes.  As long as I ate well I was happy.  Even if it was skewed from a normal Monday morning.

I checked the time.  It was 5:34, and I knew Sage was likely on his way.  I felt butterflies in my stomach as I finished baking the frittata in the oven.  As I was pulling out the frittata there was a knock at the door.  I moved the pan to the hot plate to answer the door.

I knew it was Sage no one else would be up at this hour.  Both Jace and Dorian hated early mornings.  I opened the door with a bright smile and saw one in return.  Sage grinned at me, "Hey.  Fancy meeting you here."

"Drake's still asleep, I was just finishing up."  I stepped aside and let Sage in.  He walked in past me and his shoulder dragged along my chest.  When he was inside I closed the door and put my hand on his chest stopping his progress.  We stood just past the closed door his shoulder pressed against my chest and my hand in the middle of his.  We were smiling at each other like we were mad men and his blue eyes sparkled with desire.  I bet mine were dark with it.  I leaned closer and whispered, "I want to kiss you."

Sage chuckled and put his hand on my waist, "You don't have to ask."

"Actually, I do."  Sage quirked an eyebrow at me in question.  "You told me to wait on that."

"Ah."  Sage laughed again catching himself and biting his bottom lip to silence himself.  

I leaned in and pressed my lips against his tentatively but Sage was pliant and I pushed a little harder and licked his lips.  His lips parted and my tongue entered his mouth caressing his lips.  Sage's hand found its way to my head, and we were deepening the kiss.  My body tightened low, and I let the small sound escape my lips.  I had wanted this for far too long.  I kept my hand on his chest afraid if I moved it we'd be writhing on the couch in moments.  I wanted it to last forever, this moment.

Sage pulled away when his stomach rumbled.  "I guess I'm hungrier than I thought."  He winked at me.  "Feed me, Seymore."

I laughed and didn't try to hide it.  Drake was getting up in a second, anyway. "All right.  Can you pour some milk for me and Drake and whatever you want?  Glasses are in the cabinet next to the fridge."  I pointed to which side so it wasn't a guessing game still.

Drake was not so easy to wake up.  I tapped him before I had to shake a little harder.  His groggy little orange eyes opened, and he grinned at me.  "It's time to eat."

"Cake?"

I laughed.  "This is the last piece of cake we have, so you can have it for breakfast, or you can wait to have it for dinner tonight?"

"Cake!"  Drake grinned up at me.

"All right.  Go to the bathroom and then wash your hands.  We have company, okay?"

Drake nodded and looked around me to see Sage waving back at him.  "Hi."  Drake got up and ran into the bathroom and didn't shut the door.  Privacy was not something a three-year-old needed.

Sage sat down the stool away from the wall and I wrapped my arms around him and nuzzled against his neck.  I took a deep breath and smiled.  "I could stay here forever."

Sage laughed.  "You aren't afraid of being a bad influence?"

"I will be a bad influence even if he doesn't see my sexual preferences.  And this is doing no more than he will see anywhere else.  It's not like I'm even kissing you.  I could bite your neck."

Drake popped out with dripping hands.  "Like a vampire?" he asked.

"I could but I wouldn't be feeding on him, just playing."  I smiled, and I pulled away from Sage to help Drake up into the stool next to my boyfriend.  This was a pretty picture.

I served three plates and pushed one to each of them and leaned on the other side of the counter looking at the two new men in my life.  Big change, but something I wanted.  Something I needed.  How things had changed.

"I think I need more room here to feed all the people in my life."  I grinned across at Sage who was happily eating away at his breakfast.  Drake however was staring at me with a frown on his face.  "Am I forgetting something?"  I asked him.

The look on his face screamed traitor.  "Cake!"

I laughed. "You mean this cake?"  I slide a slice of cake to Drake and he dug in right away like I'd take it away.  I looked at Sage with smile.  "You want the other piece?"

Sage shook his head.  "This is good.  I'm good."

I laughed and set it down in front of us with two forks.  "If we don't eat it, he will."  Drake's eyes went wide, and I added, "If Sage won't share it with me, you can have it for dinner, but this is the last of the cake for a while, all right?"

Drake nodded and finished his cake and drank almost the whole glass of milk before he started in on his frittata.  

"You really start with dessert?"  Sage asked.

"If I eat desert, yes it's usually first.  It's my rebel side.  Convention says dessert is last, so I ate it first to piss people off.  It became a thing when I started this life style.  When I realized that what I put in my body meant more than what a Venatori did.  My metabolism isn't like theirs.  I'm much more human than I am Venatori.  But I'm not human either, magic, super senses, the ability to heal almost any wound without the help of my ability, magic is just a few things that set me part from humans.  Being raised by Venatori changed the way I would see the world.  Being an orphan does that too.  I learned to cope with my strange fence straddling world.  Just like I'm sure you did.  And what Drake will have to do."

Drake laughed, "You talk too much."  He pushed his plate across the bar.  "More please."

I had been wrong.  He would eat more than one person.  I gave him another slice of the frittata and slide it back to him.  I had finished mine during my explanation.  Sage had completed his too and was contemplating the chocolate cake in front of him.  I picked up a fork and took a small piece and offered it to Sage and he stared at the fork then at me with a smile.  "Fine."  He opened his mouth and took the offered morsel.

I took a piece and ate it myself, handing Sage the other fork.  Drake pouted.  I grinned at him, "Sorry man.  Maybe next time."

Sage cut a piece of the cake and plopped it on to Drake's plate and leaned over and whispered into the little dragon's ear, "Eat it quick before he sees."

I rolled my eyes but turned to get a cup of coffee.  "Coffee?"  I asked Sage.

"God.  Yes. Please."  Sage drawled out like he was dying.

"Sugar? Milk?  anything?"  I asked.

"Black is fine."  Sage grinned.  "You don't have any of that, anyway."

"Sure I do.  I just don't drink it that way most of the time."

Sage laughed.  "Too many calories?"

I nodded with a grin.  "I indulge on Starbuck's coffee every so often with some of their high calorie deals but not often.  I like my coffee to taste like coffee."

Sage grinned.  "That's good to know.  So if I wanted to spoil you with things you don't normally eat, what would you suggest.  Milk shakes don't seem to be your thing, chocolate cake, over the top coffees don't seem to make you splurge."

I shrugged.  "Chocolate will usually win in any form.  Pumpkin pie is a favorite and a regular treat.  Bonnie makes a great pumpkin pie."

Sage laughed, "So you are the reason pumpkin pie is always on the menu even when it's not fall."

I nodded. "That and steak."

Drake hopped out of his chair and ran to the bathroom to wash his hands again.  He was pulling at his pj shirt and trying to get dressed.  I watched him as he walked into the coffee table and glared at it with one orange eye peaking out of the button hole.  "It's easier if you unbutton it."

By the time he had the shirt off he was grinning and pulling out a black t-shirt and jeans from his own bag.  "Twins," he declared.

Sage had disappeared behind me and had washed the food dishes and I turned to watch him in my kitchen.  He looked back at me with a smile, "You cooked."

"I can do that, ya know?" I smiled back at him then wrapped my arms around his waist and kissed his neck.  "Thank you. I'm going to help Drake get dressed."

Sage nodded, "All right."

Drake sat on the floor tugging on his tiny jeans and I picked him up and sat him on my lap and helped him.  I tickled his little belly and stood him up while I button the jeans.  "Ain't you handsome?"

He beamed from ear to ear.  I instructed, "Brush your teeth.  The blue one is new."

Sage sat down next to me, "You keep new toothbrushes out for company?"

I grinned.  "Yes and no.  Jace stops by and crashes once in a while. It was time to replace them, so it's just not been used.  I'll have to put another one out for Jace.  Maybe you'll earn a toothbrush too."  I leaned my shoulder against him and pushed softly.

Sage laughed and pushed back.  "Or maybe I'll just use yours."  Sage was watching my reaction to the tease.  

I took a deep breath, and he laughed.  "Not a good idea?"

"No."  I frowned.  "I mean, it's no different from sharing spit when we kiss, but I dunno just something about it."  I shuddered.

Drake came out carrying my toothbrush and handed it to me,  "Brush, mister."

I stood up and took Sage's hand.  "We better listen." 

I opened the mirror behind the sink with a press against the side and pulled out a green and red toothbrush, "Which one you want?"  I asked Sage.

I picked up the toothpaste while he grabbed the red one.  I plunked the green into the toothbrush holder for whenever Jace came by again.  This was the most toothbrushes I'd had in my bathroom at any one time.  

It wasn't awkward with Drake standing over us watching us to make sure we brushed our teeth well.  Sage tried to fake it by not using toothpaste which earned him a scolding from Drake with the waggling index finger telling Sage no, no, no, no.  I didn't get in trouble, it was a true miracle.

Sage stopped at the front door and frowned at the watch on his wrist.  "I gotta catch the train to be in my chair by 8."

I nodded.  "All right."  I turned to Drake, "Come say bye to Sage, he has to go."

Drake hugged Sage's legs and Sage picked him up for a better hug before he patted him on the head and Drake was off towards the bed.

"Thanks for breakfast."  Sage said as he grabbed my waist and pulled me close.  "It was delicious.  And I loved the company."

"I enjoyed it myself."  I smiled as I leaned my forehead against his.  We kissed again softly.  My knees felt weak and my hands were hanging awkwardly against his hands.  When we parted I was trying to catch my breath without being dramatic about it.  

Sage laughed at me and kissed my cheek. "Call me when you can, Nox."

I nodded. "Okay. Oh. Hey.  I have a date with a girl tonight around 6.  You want to be here?"

Sage frowned.  "Won't that be awkward?  I mean for everyone."

I shrugged.  "Yeah.  But I don't want you to think I'm hiding this from you.  I want you to meet her.  If you don't like her, then she can't be the one.  She could be in my life for a long time."  I gave Sage a peck on the lips softly.  "And if you are going to be in my life for a long time, then we need to all be on common ground."

Sage shook his head.  "No.  I think you need to work out the details with her, then I can meet her.  You can still say no, it won't work right?"

I nodded. "I guess.  I've never had to do this before.  Any of it."

Sage smiled. "I'd love to have dinner with you.  And I am glad you want me to approve of your baby-mama.  But we just started this, Nox.  Don't rely on me for this. This is strange enough as it is."

I nodded and felt the nagging feeling of rejection tinging the edges of my senses.  "I'll call you later."  My voice had fallen flat and Sage heard the change and the hurt feelings.  I opened the door and waited for him to leave, but he stood where he was watching me.  

"It means that much to you?"  He asked.

I shook my head.  "No.  I wouldn't do this if I didn't have to.  I'll drop it.  You have to get to work Sage.  Don't be late because of me."

"Nox..."  Sage stepped closer and I looked at the floor.  "I'll come to dinner if it'll make you feel better."

"No, it's all right, Sage.  I don't care about dinner.  I've been told no before."  

Sage took my chin between his fingers and lifted my eyes to meet his.  "What's wrong then?"

"Nothing."

"Don't give me that bullshit.  You can't stop talking about mundane things.  You will not clam up when it matters."  Sage's voice held a quite sort of rage behind it.

I tried to look down but Sage made me look up at him with slight pressure on my chin.  He asked again, "What's wrong?"

"You reminded me I become attached too quickly."  I glanced at the time on the stove, "You will miss your train."

"I'll be late."  He said closing the door with a loud click.  "I'm here for the third day in the row."  Sage frowned.  "I don't do one night stands, Nox.  This is not a ploy to get in your pants.  I think we've established the fact that we could have both done that several times already and gone our separate ways.  You've met my family.  I've met parts of what you consider family.  Fast yes?  But I'm here.  I'm a little weirded out because you have to sleep with some girl just to have a baby." 

"You think I'm not?"  I sighed and pulled away from Sage then walked over to my dresser and pulled the envelope out from under the folders on top of it.  I took the document out.  "This is the contract we signed when we became adults.  Every Venatori has one."  I pulled the last page from the packet and I found a pen on the coffee table and signed the paper then handed it to Sage.

I watched his face while he read it - It clearly stated that in the event I did not bear a child in the first five years I wouldbe fined 50% of my stipend for a year and for every year until I bear the first child.  After the tenth year and failure to produce my two heirs a lump sum is fined.  My signature on the line indicated they should garnish my wages when my five years was up.

Sage stared at me as I plucked the paper from his hands.  "Make you feel better?"

"You said you still had a year left."  Sage sounded confused.

"A year I plan on spending with you.  And if you aren't comfortable now with me sleeping with some girl to make a baby, what makes you think when we've been together for six months or nine it will get any easier.  They might as well start now."  I opened the door again.  "Drake, come on, let's go."  I turned back to Sage.  "You missed your train, if you hurry there is another one in three minutes."

Sage pulled the paper from my hands and grabbed my wrist, "You'd do this for me?  Because I can't deal with it?"

"Why wouldn't I?  Money isn't going to make me happy."  I grabbed the paper, but he refused to release it.

He smiled at me.  "But I will?"

"That's my hope."  I stared at him waiting for him to just let things go so we could move on and get over this.  He wanted to dwell, and I was over it now.

Sage pried my fingers from the paper with ease.  He smiled as he tore it in half.  I couldn't see the look on my face but I'm sure I was wide eyed and open mouthed wondering what the fuck he was doing.  "Meet with the girl.  If she works for you, I'll meet her.  We'll decide what to do then.  Okay?"

Drake grabbed my hand and tugged me out the door.  "Wet's go."

Sage took my other hand and tossed the paper into the garbage bin near the door.  "I have a train to catch."  Sage wandered towards the stairs and he pulled me into the stair well and once the other side of the door he kissed me hard.  

I could have collapsed into his arms but I stood my ground and walked down the stairs with both of them holding my hands.  Sage grinned at me, "We okay?"

I nodded.  "We were never not okay, Sage."

"You were mad."  He said.

"I was afraid Sage.  I wasn't mad.  I am terrified of being hurt.  My life has been nothing but people I love deserting me, and the people who are supposed to care don't care enough."

Sage frowned, "Dorian cares."

"He does now.  But it wasn't always the case.  I grew on him and Dae'lin.  I was just another kid at first when I needed parents I didn't have them."  I shrugged.  "It doesn't matter.  I survived.  I'm just a little fucked up."

Sage laughed, "A little?"

I leaned over and kissed his cheek.  "This is the Academy.  You can catch the elevator here."

We kissed goodbye in the stairwell and parted ways at the elevator. Drake whispered up at me, "I wike him."

"Me too, Drake.  Me too."
