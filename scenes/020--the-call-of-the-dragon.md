# The Call of the Dragon

Dae'lin returned shortly after I explained my day to Walker.  How Trix and Truth had found best possible location of the man claiming to be The Dragon.  She smiled at Walker, "Good to see you walking around.  You'll have to tell us your secret."

Walker laughed.  "A good swift thinking partner."

Dae'lin looked at me and smiled then back to my partner.  "So are you intending to stay working together?" she asked.

I shrugged with a grin.  "Long as he doesn't slow me down."

Walker nodded.  "Ditto."

Dae'lin laughed.  "I never thought I'd see the day when Nox Sétanta had a willing partner and willingly partnering with him.  And I mean that in so many senses of the word."  She looked towards Sage who was still holding my hand.  "As for you Truth, you and Trix are welcome to work with us anytime you feel the desire.  Well you are, Trix will work for us if she wishes to survive her criminal activities."

Sage smiled at her.  "My pleasure.  Though I think I'll limit my excursions to emergencies."

Dae'lin nodded.  "Emerson's death has been accepted in the morgue as an accident.  Thank you for the articles on spontaneous combustion, planting the evidence was easy.  As for our little hacker, we'll get her safe and secure and let her do her own clean up."

I grinned at Sage.  I hadn't asked what he'd helped Dae'lin with earlier, I guess I had just found out.

Dae'lin spoke.  "I also put out a feeler out to the vampires and wolves in the city and hope they can keep an ear out.  When I told them who was going in, even my squealers said they'd watch your back.  That's saying a lot, Nox.  What The Last Phoenix is doing is beyond just us.  The Dragon Council will be here within the day, so you need to catch him before they get here or he will be lost to us."

I sighed.  "Do they know about Drake?"

Sage interrupted.  "I'll watch him, Nox. You do your thing, don't worry about the boy.  I'll make sure no one takes him."

I hugged Sage close and kissed the side of his head.  "Much appreciated.  No one I'd rather trust.  But if you need help Dorian or Kai can help."

"I've not met your father, I don't think I will ask for help from him."

Dae'lin took Sage by the elbow.  "Let me introduce you to Kai.  It's better if Nox isn't around. Trust me."

I sighed but nodded. "Yeah, oka,y fine.  Take Drake with you."

Dae'lin nodded.  "Good luck boys.  Come back safe and in one piece."

Walker went off a distance with Dae'lin, the pair giving Sage and I a moment alone in the hall.  Sage looked more concerned now that he was alone with me.  "I guess I will have to get use to you fighting the good fight, eh?"

I frowned but nodded.  "I'm a hunter.  This is what I do."

Sage nodded.  "I couldn't ask you to stop even if I wanted to.  It's like asking me to never touch a computer again.  And you have no idea how much that possibility hurt me."

"I'll come back safe."  I kissed him then whispered against his lips.  "I still have so much I want to do with you."  I wrapped my arms around my boyfriend and hugged him tight to my body whispering in his ear, "And so much of it has nothing to do with what I want to do to your body."

Sage laughed and pushed me away with a grin.  "You only want me for my body."

I winked at him.  "Damn straight."

"No such luck, love."  Sage said pulling me close and kissing me passionately.  I wanted to drown in him and had by the time he pulled away and was looking into my eyes with his bright blue sapphires.  "Stay safe.  I got your family here.  You don't worry about anything other than coming back."

Sage gave me a peck on the check and then walked away leaving me wanting more but knowing walking away was far harder than it looked, for both of us.

Walker was shaking his head as he approached me.  "It's hard when you have someone who cares about you that much."  He said as he turned me the other direction.  "I need to hit the armory."

I nodded and let Walker lead me to the secured area of the building where the weapons and other equipment was kept for such missions.

Walker grabbed dragon piercing rounds for his gun and a box for me.  "Where's yours?"

I sighed.  "In my room.  We can stop up there and grab it.  I don't like carrying Salvation and Damnation around the City unless I have to."

Walker laughed.  "You named your guns?"

I grinned.  "My gun and my knife.  Knife won't do much against a dragon but it's got other useful things too if necessary, a survival knife."

We retrieved my mundane weapons, and I loaded the weapon with dragon piercing rounds just in case.  Both held in their holsters underneath my black leather jacket made for just that purpose.

And Walker and I were off to the Dragon's office.  We were off to fight a dragon, an honest to god real life dragon who claimed to be THE dragon.  As in the one who ruled them all.  But he wasn't, there was no such all-powerful dragon.  It was just a myth they liked to perpetrate to scare the masses.

Ye Pan had an office at the Empire State building, but he lived in an apartment a short distance away.  Both were not places we wanted to have a knock down drag out fight, but right now we were just scouting out the area.  Neither Walker nor I looked the part to just waltz into Mr. Pan's office and we looked like a high end thug if we waited for him outside his high rise apartment building.  

Strike one for poor planning.  I stayed outside the Empire State building behind a veil with my phone silenced. I wasn't daft.  No one saw me while Walker went back home to become more presentable.
The street was crowded but everyone avoided me.  The world passed me by without noticing I existed. The thought might have bothered me if I wasn't used to it already.  While I waited, I saw Ye Pan leaving the building and walking towards the train station. I called Walker while I followed him down.  "He's on the move.  Track me."

I hung up after I said what I needed.  Pan got on the next train and I followed.  Still hidden by my veil, I had to be careful.  Dragon's could sense my magic because it was born of the same thing.  He got off the train and I let myself get lost in the crowd before I followed him up and about.

Trailing someone was never easy but in the city it was easier on foot.  Mr. Pan walked for several blocks before turning down an alleyway.  I opened myself to the surrounding magic.  I could feel dragons all around.  At least my magic would now blend in.  But I saw the shadow of The Dragon.  It was much larger than any I had seen before.  I could almost make out the green and bronze scales of his Chinese dragon form.  

The funny thing about the shadows though, they were always smaller than their true forms.  Which meant if Ye Pan shifted I would face a rather large reptile that could breathe fire and swallow me whole while barely batting an eye.  No pressure!

I didn't bother checking in with Walker.  He'd come eventually.  I followed at a safe distance behind my veil but even then I felt exposed, but the man never looked back, not even once.

He went into a creepy looking building.  The garage door opened as he approached and I knew this would be rough.  I had to run to catch up before the door closed on me.  I rolled underneath the closing metal door and skinned elbow against the ground pulling myself inside.  

The air was cooler inside and I had to move quickly or get walked on.  The place was full of people, mostly dragons.  But I felt a few other species running around, wolf and vampire, but sometimes the magic was hard to determine with this many so close together.

I followed Ye Pan through the crowd of people.  He found the stair case up and went to the second level of the two story warehouse.  Following him would be difficult.  At least if I were a human, but I used the same trick I did when I crept downstairs to catch Trix.  The air made my way up soundless and far more stable than using the actual stairs.

I followed him on the second floor scaffolding.  It was never meant to be permanent but like many things it was convenient enough and was left intact.

Ye Pan went into a locked room by punching a code in the keypad.  I watched him hitting the numbers on the pad.  Unlike Dorian I didn't remember everything I saw, but I absorbed patterns and the code for entry was just that a pattern.  I smiled to myself as he walked through the closed door.  I wouldn't make it to the door before it closed, but I didn't have to.  I wove a thin strip of air to keep the door from shutting and walked to it without making a sound.  It wasn't nearly as easy as it sounded as the scaffolding creaked and sputtered under any weight.

I widened my veil to hide the door before I opened it.  Everyone saw what they expected to see, nothing, but the door closed.

I walked through and dropped the veil outside and retained my personal one.  The hallway lead into the depths of the warehouse.  There was a slight hum of machinery below my feet that vibrated through the floor.  I could feel the hum in my bones.  I didn't know what was going on here, I didn't care.  But I had to find out what Ye Pan was doing and take him down. I'd prefer to take him in but I didn't think he'd come quietly, the big bads never did.

I followed him through into wide open room where Ye Pan sat on a throne, an honest to fucking god throne. It was gilded in gold and bore red velvet cushions with red rubies I could guarantee weren't fake.  He sat looking at me through the veil.  "I can see you, Venatori."

I let the veil drop.   He laughed.  "A little more colorful than I expected."  He waved a hand and a small breeze combed through my dyed tips of my hair and brushed against my skin.  "But as the rumor tree goes, I'm glad it's you and not another with your dragon armor bullets.  You rely on  your our magic too much young one."

Ye Pan's accent was thick with his native tongue.  It almost felt exaggerated, like he was mocking his own kind.  Maybe he was.  Many of the older beings lost their accents to blend into whatever society they felt was necessary of the time.  I knew Cari and Ant both had whereas Tony and Francesco still held their native accent when speaking English.

"I am what I am.  I don't assume you will come with me without a fight."  I said.

Pan laughed again.  "I do believe you are correct, my dear boy."  Ye Pan stood up, and I felt more than saw the dragon claws form on his hand.  The pull of the beast beckoning me forth with one crock of his clawed talon.  I'd never seen a dragon powerful enough to shift a single body part.  

The smile on Pan's face faded when I didn't come closer.  His eyes shifted to their green reptile color, and he bled more power into the room.  It felt like I was drowning in the room.  "Come."  He said.  I felt the pull and as much as I tried to stay in place I could not.  It was like I was on puppet strings.  One foot forced itself forward, then the second, each one a fight before I fell to my knees to impede my movement.

Ye Pan laughed.  "You are too willful."  The power from The Dragon bled from every pore in his body, green and bronze scales covered his skin as he let loose the power of the dragon and he lowered his hand and my body bowed beneath the implied crushing movement.  I was helpless to the power.  Dragon blood ran through my veins.  It was not an untruth but he shouldn't have power over me.  I knew this, and I fought with this power.  I would not be cowed by anyone.  Well, that wasn't the truth.  I knew one person I would bend for each time he asked, every time he asked.

I relaxed under the knowledge that this meant nothing.  I let The Dragon's power flow around me - through me and I thought of the strength I had on my own.

The power poured through me as a gun shot rang in the surrounding emptiness.  I looked up and saw a single bullet floating in front of Ye Pan.  His face turned towards the window. Walker stood with a small team of other Venatori.  My father was among them.  I could feel their power among the others around me.

Ye Pan laughed, and he turned to me.  "Take care of your friends."  With a further crushing weight he pressed his power into me.  I stood not of my free will.  The Dragon's power wielded my body like a weapon,  a puppet to be aimed at the others.

The others gasped and I saw the look of horror on my father's face.  I cringed inside as I formed a fireball that I had no control over.  The patterns bent and shaped while I fought against each thread of fire and air.  I closed my eyes and focused on the blue eyes I'd fallen so deeply in love with so quickly.  

I opened my eyes and watched as the fireball flew towards my father and my partner.  They were jumping to the sides and over the railing to avoid the collision with the flames.  It splattered against a wall of air.  The Dragon controlled me but I had enough will to do more than his bidding. 

I felt my power rip away, and the wall fell seconds after the fireball hit.  I smiled at Ye Pan.  He bent me in half, crushing me against the ground again.  "If you will not obey."

I couldn't see anything with my face pressed to the cold concrete, but I didn't need to see.  I let my sense go.  I felt everything, saw everything with the patterns of energy.  I could feel my father through the floor he stood on.  I could see the air that Walker breathed.  Dorian's father was still on the scaffolding a distance from where he'd started, I knew from the connection to the floor that his gun was aimed at me.  Dragon piercing bullets would kill me the same as The Dragon.

I felt Ye Pan's wrath being wielded against my partner and father and the fourth Venatori who'd joined them.  A woman I didn't know.  A woman I wouldn't ever know as the fire that encased her was burning her alive before I could react.

I pressed my fingers into the concrete below and pushed earth and air and fire into the ground in front of me.  The floor jutted up, and the room shook under the strain of earth erupting through the beams.  Fire sprung from beneath and the air pushed it towards The Dragon.  

He turned as the first wave encompassed him.  The first wave removed his hold over me.  I stood up feeling his power trying to take my head again.  I smiled at him.  "I'm not a dragon, Ye Pan.  I. Am. Venatori."

He looked at me with wide eyes as his cage of earth formed around him pinning him to the ground.  I stood over him while he tried to weave pattern after pattern at me.  I silenced them with ease.  Seeing the pattern was only the start of it, knowing how to undo it was always the fun part.  I smiled at him.  Fireball countered by air and water as it formed.   Bonds of air sliced by earth as they tried to wrap around my body.  I drew Damnation from her home at my waist and I pointed it at Ye Pan.  "One last chance, will you come peacefully?"

The Dragon spat at my shoes in front of him.  "That's what I thought."  I removed the safety and squeezed the trigger and put a single dragon piercing round into his forehead. 

I pulled the fire alarm with a weave of air as I set Ye Pan's body on fire with a weave.  It would burn until it and everything in the building was cinder. And then and only then would the magic fade and let the flames die.  There would be nothing left of this operation.  I didn't know what it was.  I didn't care.  The Venatori evacuated everyone as I sat on the end of the docking bay while the building burned around them. I  controlled the flames until every last soul, supernatural or otherwise, was clear.

Walker came up and put his hand on my shoulder. "Everyone's out."

I jumped off the platform with a kick of my legs and landed with a soft jar to my knees before I turned around and let the flames go, setting the magical barrier that would let it all burn to the ground damaging no other property.

We walked away in silence.  My father and Emilio waited at the end of the alleyway for us.  They would carry the bad news to the woman who had passed in The Dragon's fire.  Emilio and Walker refused to let Kai tell me her name.  Emilio making him promise to not tell me.

It didn't matter either way.  I would find out her name.  When we joined Walker and Emilio pulled ahead of my father and I. 

Kai watched me as we walked.  Emilio and Walker went down the stairs to the subway station I didn't feel like joining them, but I was surprised when my father kept walking with me.  We walked two additional blocks in silence until Kai broke it.  "I didn't know you had it in you."

"Know I had what in me?" I asked.

"To pull the trigger on a man."  Kai said.  I could hear the concern in his voice.  "What did he do to you?"

"He controlled me.  What did it look like?"  I said, my voice dripped with sarcasm.

"How?"

"Dragon Blood."  

"That should be weak inside of you - half human and all. He couldn't control me."

I sighed.  "I'm Cesari you are not.  You can't bend all four elements."

Kai nodded.  "Still, you shouldn't go up against dragons again until we explore it."

"Whatever."  I moved forward at a faster pace but my father kept pace with ease.  So I stopped instead.  My father followed suit a few paces ahead of me.  He turned to look at me.  I asked him, "You aren't great at this are you?"

"Good at what?" My father returned the question.

"At pretending you care."

Kai closed the few paces between us and I took an involuntary step backwards as my father stepped into my personal space.  He'd backed me up against the wall and held his finger in front of me to scold me. I stared back with a look of defiance etched on my features, but I could the fear in my pulse rise as he did it.  But he didn't scare me, not in my rational mind.  But my mind was never rational.  I felt like the child I had been before I knew Kai Viddens was my father.  I felt five with Garrett standing over me wielding the same finger and the fury of his hidden powers with them.  The intensity of the lessons that day would be worse.  Flashes of my nightmares floated before my eyes.

I don't know what my father saw on my face but his face softened as he took a step back and lowered his hand.  "Who the fuck messed you up?"

I knew I should answer him or face his wrath but my mouth was dry I couldn't speak even if I wanted to.  I felt lost, even more so than before.  All control was gone.  My father could manipulate me like The Dragon except it was my fear, my memories that paralyzed my body from doing what I wanted it to do.  "Those scars on your back.  They aren't just you were they?"

I shook my head.  "I used to hide them."

"Why don't you now?"  Kai asked his voice was softer now. 

"No point.  Too much work.  I'm not required to disrobe in front of strangers.  And I forget now I should when in the gym."

Kai asked, "You okay?"

"No.  I need to go home."  It was the truth.  All I wanted was to curl up in my bed and cry.  But I wouldn't tell that to my absentee father.

"Let's go then.  We will take the next train."  Kai glanced at his watch and then reached for my shoulder which I pulled away from immediate.  Kai dropped his hand to his sides.  "Let's go, son.  I'll make sure you make it to your apartment.  Do you need me to tell someone?"

I only shrugged as we walked.  I wanted Sage to be there.  But I wasn'y about to put this on him. The next station was only half a block away and as we were going down I whispered, "Can you make sure Drake has a place to stay tonight?"

Kai nodded.  "He can stay with me.  Unlike most of my children you grant me that privilege occasionally."

I gave my father a weak smile.  "Don't try to be a good father.  Be a great grandfather for him.  You and me, we'll work on it through him."

Kai laughed.  "That's exactly what Margo said."

I gave him a genuine smile.  "She's a smart woman."
