# Bigger Than We Thought

I was going to walk home, but I figured I'd forget to call Sage when I did.  I could pick up Drake and we could spend the night tossing and turning, but then I'd deprive my father of his grandson.  I still took the train home, and I was walking up the stairs as I sent Sage a text.

When I was in my apartment, I sent another text with a selfie lying on my bed.

I curled up in my bed with my pillow.  There were four extra pillows now, I'd had some delivered from a store down stairs.  My phone sat on top and I closed my eyes to sleep.  If I got a response from Sage I'd wake up, if not I'd dream of him, anyway.  The sound of a loud smacking kiss woke me from the drifting I had been doing.  I glanced at my phone to see what Sage had sent.

I turned the screen off and closed my eyes.  I was still tired from my earlier extension of my energy when killing Emerson.  It was a fact I hadn't told Sage yet.  I felt the darkness take me but then I heard a soft knock at my door.  I blinked as I turned the screen on my phone and looked at the time.  

I crawled out of bed and padded over to the door in the dark, opened the door and found my mysterious blue eyed boy standing there with a grin.  I smiled and stepped aside taking his hand as he stepped inside.  I didn't say anything as I locked the door and pulled him towards my bed.  I crawled into bed and Sage stood next to the side and pulled off his t-shirt and kicked off his shoes before he sat down to tug off his jeans.  I watched the way his body moved in the dim light coming from the night light in the bathroom.

He sat there on the edge of my bed for several moments.  I don't know what he was thinking.  His back drew my attention as I watched him breathe slowly in and out.  The muscles in his back were strong and I wanted to touch him.  I reached out several times but never laid my hands on his beautiful skin.  Sage laid down on to his back with a deep sigh.  I covered him with the remaining blankets and he looked over at me with bright blue eyes that I couldn't see in the dim light, but I knew what color they were.  I dreamt about them every night.  I loved his eyes.

I smiled at him and offered him my hand; he entwined our fingers together  and laid them down between us.  I moved closer.  Sage let out a soft sigh before he moved down and closer to me, his shoulder resting under my chin and his head laying against mine.  I took a deep breath and savored the scent of him in my bed.  Butterflies swirled in my stomach as I closed my eyes.  I tightened my fingers around Sage's and he hummed softly in my ear.  "Night, Nox."  He whispered.  I kissed his shoulder and whispered in return, "Night, Sage."

Sleep came.  So did the dreams.  The dreams always came, but they were different.  Less vivid.  The red glowing eyes weren't quite so red.  More a soft glow just barely making out a color.  The pain imagined from the blows was still unimaginable.  But when the face came into view and it was time to wake up, I didn't stare into the eyes of my demon and start awake panting for breath.  I opened my eyes slowly and saw Sage watching me.  His eyes were wide open but there was concern written all over his face.  He spoke softly, "You okay?"

I smiled at him and nodded.  I didn't want to break the spell I was under.  I felt at peace seeing him in my bed.  It was hard to breathe but not from the dream.  I leaned forward closing the small gap between us and kissed Sage softly.  "I had a nightmare, but it wasn't as bad as usual.  I'm all right."

Sage sat up in bed and looked down at me.  "That wasn't a bad nightmare?  I'd hate to see a bad one."

I looked up at him confused.  He smiled down at me and kissed my lips before he continued.  "You were holding on so tight I was afraid my fingers might fall off."  He was making light of the situation.

"I'm sorry."  I sat up and joined Sage.  I found my phone nestled between the pillows where I'd lain it earlier.  I glanced at the time and was surprised it was 5.  I looked at Sage, "Did I sleep through the alarm?"

Sage grinned.  "Yes and no.  I kinda turned it off when I found it last night.  You would have slept with it last night?"

"I was in bed texting you last night.  I'd fallen asleep after inviting you over."

Sage grinned.  "I'm glad you did.  You could have stayed at my place."

I nodded.  "Yeah, but I promised my father and Drake I'd make them breakfast this morning so Drake wouldn't be late for school. I guess that means you can meet my father."

"That doesn't sound like something you want me to do."  Sage said

"My father doesn't like that I like men.  He doesn't like that when me and my brother didn't know we were half-brothers we kissed.  We would have done more than kiss if we hadn't gotten caught in the hall."

Sage grinned, "You kissed your brother?"  The scrunched up look on his face made me laugh.  He was making fun of me.  

"I didn't know he was my brother.  Since we found out who my father was we've gone out a couple times to pick up guys.  He and I are the only two in my family that are even remotely close.  Even the only biological full brother and sister aren't close.  But then when you aren't raised together and spend 80% of your time living in the dorms you don't become a family.  And they all lived with their mothers despite being Kai's legacy, except Iris.  She's a Monroe through and through."

"How many half siblings do you have?"  Sage asked as he took me in his arms and cuddled while leaning against the wall behind the bed.

"I have five.  Adam and Iris are both a product of the progeny program.  They are official heirs to their respective families.  Tobias, Marius and Nicholas are from three other women.  Nick is a Hampton.  My father sired an heir for Nick's mom when she asked.  Tobias, Marius and I were accidental pregnancies.  None of them had been planned.  My father didn't find out about me until I was 18 years old."

"Why did it take so long?" Sage asked as he rubbed small circles against my back.  

I was lost in the sensation of his touch. I almost didn't answer him.  But I did with a shrug.  "My mother told Dorian when she left me with him that she didn't want me to know.  And since she was legally my guardian, he had to listen to her.  The first vacation we had was a small summer break, when Dorian contacted her she told him, she had no son, and that I was Dorian's problem now.  Dorian let me stay on his couch for the two weeks we were out of school and supposed to be spending time with our families.  I spent time with his family.  His mom would take me to work with her.  Or Dorian would take me with him.  Most of the time I after that first year I'd go home with Jace."

Sage kissed my forehead.  "I can't wait to meet him."

"I'm sure Jace and Mia can't wait to meet you."  I pulled out of his embrace and crawled out of bed.  "Coffee?"

Sage nodded as he snuggled down into my bed and wrapped himself around my pillow.  I smiled at him as he shyly looked at me over the pillow.  "You are too cute."

Sage grinned.  "Too cute?  No such thing."

I laughed, but I walked away into my kitchen and I felt Sage's eyes following me as I turned on the dimmer lights in the kitchen and fixed coffee.  It was still a little before we had to be down the hall for breakfast.

I leaned on the bar that overlooked my living space and watched my boyfriend watching me.  He hid his face behind the pillow with one eye peaking out.  I grinned at him and he threw the pillow across the room and it landed on the couch and no where near me.

I continued to watch him lying in my bed.  Sage was trying to look comfortable, but he was failing miserably.  He got up from the bed and padded his near naked body towards me in the kitchen.  I watched the muscles move in his legs, the way he stepped gingerly over the cool carpeted floor.  I was grinning madly by the time he stopped in front of me pinning me against the corner of the bar and counter set up.  The full length of his body was pressed against mine.  I could feel his breath on my cheek.  He whispered, "When's coffee going to be ready?" 

I glanced at the coffee pot out of the corner of my eye.  I smiled.  "There is a cup in the pot now if you can't wait."

He grinned at me from mere inches away.  "I can wait till you can have one, too."

Sage didn't move.  He continued to press my back into the inner corner of the counter and bar.  We stared into each other's eyes sharing the air between us.  I could feel the warmth of Sage's skin through my t-shirt and boxers.  The attraction was intense as we stood there as close as possible but not doing anything other than being close.  I wanted so much more than what we were doing but I could feel the fear of rejection and commitment pressing against my brain trying to make me panic.

I buried my face in the crook of Sage's neck and he pulled me against him even tighter than we had been.  His arms were tight around my waist, one hand was running small circles against the small of my back.  I mumbled into his skin, "I think coffee's ready."

Sage turned to look at me, pulling me away from him slightly, "This is good."  He gave me a peck on my lips and pulled the two coffee cups towards him and grabbed the now full coffee pot.  "Don't be afraid of this, okay?"

I nodded.  "That's easier said than done."  I smiled and sipped at the coffee Sage handed me.

Sage grinned.  "As long as you hide in me, don't be afraid of me."

I nodded and watched over the edge of my cup as Sage drank his.  We were still close but our bodies were no longer touching, I felt cold without him pressed against me.  I felt more alone without him.  I don't know why, but I could feel the anchors of my soul being tied around this man.  I would drown in him.  I hope I didn't make him cut the tether that was binding me too him so tightly.

Sage set his cup down on the counter next to me, "A penny for your thoughts?"

I smiled.  "Same thing I think about when you are here with me."

"And that is?" Sage asked me with a bright smile placing his hands on either side of me but keeping his body from mine.

"That I'm drowning in you." I set my cup down on the other side. "But that's too deep of a conversation for five days into our relationship."  I smiled at him.

Sage leaned against me and kissed my neck.  "I like deep conversations."  The way he said it sent shivers down my spine and I had to swallow hard as he nipped at the skin on my neck.  He chuckled against my skin, his breath tickling my neck.  "I love that reaction." 

Sage leaned back and smiled at me.  "I should grab a shower.  You mind?"

I shook my head.  "Not at all."

I watched Sage collect his clothes from the floor and then walked into the bathroom to get him clean towels.  I set them down next to the sink and smiled at him as he stood in the door watching me.  "You could join me."

I let out a short moan, "Oh how I would love to, but that would lead to places we aren't prepared for."

Sage was grinning at me as he pulled two foil packs from his pants pocket.  "I came prepared."  He stepped inside and closed the bathroom door behind him and turned the lock.  Not that anyone would walk in - there was no one else in my apartment.  Sage set his clothes on the sink counter and hooked his thumbs in my boxers and pulled me close.  "Join me."

I swallowed hard and bit my bottom lip with a simple nod of my head I agreed.  I didn't trust my voice not to crack under the desire that was coursing through me.

We kissed and undressed each other outside the shower.  For the first time since we'd met our hands were unbidden.  I touched his warm skin with my hands.  His fingers kneading into my back.  I hid in the crook of his neck while he pulled my shirt over my head.  It wasn't the first time he'd seen my back.  But it was the first time I'd let anyone remove my shirt for me.  It was not something I did.  Sage held me close as I got over my panic attack.  He kissed and nipped at the skin on my neck while his fingers traced the mass of scars along my back.  I had to focus on something other than his touch on my untouched back less I release way sooner than intended. 

I pressed my body against him and he backed up against the cold glass shower wall and I reached inside to let the water warm while we continued outside.  I hooked my thumbs under his waist band and was dropping to my knees when a shrill ring pierced the heat of the moment.  Sage sighed, and I pressed my forehead to his thigh as he breathed out slowly then spoke, "That's Danny.  I should get it."

I sighed and sat back on my heels letting Sage move around me to answer his phone.  I didn't pay attention to anything beyond my breathing.  It was time to come down from the high, to breathe on my own again.  I felt empty without his body next to mine.  I wanted him in so many ways and sex was so far down the list I was lost in the feeling of it all.

I stood up and went for the door.  Sage followed me with is eyes.  "One second."  He said into the phone then pressed it to his naked chest.  "I'm sorry.  We can finish."

I shook my head.  "It's all right.  We both got work to do.  I'm gonna make you breakfast."  I unlocked the door and opened it quickly and slipped out shutting it behind me.  I tugged on my jeans from yesterday and a clean t-shirt.  I would shower later.  

I made pancakes.  I had intended to make them for Drake in the morning.  I had more than enough to make a few for Sage before he had to get to work.

I got lost in the food preparation and my own thoughts.  Thoughts of Sage and life and the fate of humanity if we didn't stop The Dragon.  Everything was a jumble when Sage stepped out of the bathroom patting his hair dry with a towel.  He was fully clothed much to my disappointment.  But he was gorgeous none-the-less, and I watched him as he slide into one of the bar stools with a bright smile.  "I'm sorry about that."

I pushed a plate with fresh pancakes and some macerated berries on top to Sage with a glass of orange juice and coffee.  "It happens.  Just the universe telling us we were moving too fast."

Sage took a sip of his new coffee and smiled.  "You believe, that don't you?"

I nodded.  "It confirmed my own hangups.  I want so much more than sex, Sage.  I'm afraid if we go that far too soon, it'll be the only thing between us."

"I get it." Sage said with a smile.  "One night stands have been the only thing you've ever done.  I will try to take it slower.  It's not everyday that you meet this great guy who is not only hot, but who is great in the sack and who wants to be more with you."

I grinned.  "Who said I was great in the sack?"

Sage laughed.  "Alice says you were passable."

"So that translate to great for you?"  I picked up an already cut piece of Sage's pancakes with my fingers and popped it in my mouth.

"Alice has a tendency to sleep with men who like other men more.  Her gaydar is way off.  Those that we've both slept with over the years I've always found to be much better than she let on.  So I am making an assumption but for a guy who travels in Adrian's circles you have more experience in such things."

I asked, "So have you slept with Alice?"  I still didn't remember his friend much.  

Sage nodded.  "A couple times.  Nothing recent."

"Does that mean you prefer men more?"  I asked curious.  I knew my answer to the question was yes.  It had always been that way.

Sage shook his head.  "I have no preference. I don't have sex with my partners right away."

I frowned at his answer.  Not so much that he didn't have a preference, but that he was pushing sex between the two of us.  "So why is it different with us?"

"I could ask the same of you?"  Sage smiled as he continued.  "It's been five days.  It's been fast in those five days.  But we've spent time apart in those days, and time together each and every day.  If this were one of my normal relationships, we'd have spoken maybe once or twice in between dates.  We've had five dates.  Normally that's just over a month of seeing each other every weekend for a few hours.  The sexual tension has been high since that first day.  That it took us five times before either of us asked the other is kinda amazing."

Sage smiled and said, "So tell me why it's different for you?"

I sighed.  "I hadn't expected to pick you up Friday night, I hadn't expected to pick anyone up.  I had every intention of dancing until Jace and Mia were ready to go home and then call it that.  I didn't plan on meeting a hot guy who played the game as well as I did.  And in the end you won because you left me wanting more.  You took my means of hooking up that night and you left me your card in its place.  I kept your number.  If it weren't for Mia, I probably wouldn't have called you.  But I'm glad she sent you that text.  It made me get off my ass.  But that's why you are different.  But I'm different too."

Sage asked, "How so?"

"I want to settle down.  I want a family.  I know I have to do my duty - to create an heir.  But it's more than that.  I want my own family.  I want someone to love me unconditionally, forever.  I've never had that before and having a kid guarantees that.  But I don't think it's enough.  I want someone to love me."  I turned around and packed things up to go to my father's place.  I hated bearing my soul to strangers.  Sage wasn't a stranger, but he wasn't Margo or Dorian and I didn't know how he'd react to any of that.

A hand found my belt loop, and a finger hooked it turning me to face those beautiful blue eyes.  "That's why you think this is moving too fast isn't it?  Because that's what you want in this relationship?  You want a life with me?"

I looked down.  My voice was low as I spoke. "I can't see life without you.  And it scares me to think I've grown this attached to you this fast.  And that in the end it's too fast for you.  I don't want to face the piper someday.  I'd rather do it now when it'll hurt less.  Because it's going to hurt no matter what."

Sage pulled me closer and tightened his grip on me.  "I'm not going anywhere.  Too fast or not.  Like I said earlier, this is not scaring me away.  I have my own fears."

I whispered in his ear as he held me tight and I wrapped my arms around him tighter, "Like what?"

Sage laughed in my ear.  "My fear is I can't keep your attention.  I don't have the experience you do."

I pulled away from Sage and grabbed his chin to make him look into my eyes.  "I like that you haven't done what I have.  No, I love it.  Because if you want to explore it, I get to explore it with you.  We can learn what we like together, and what we don't.  Sex is just that, Sage, it's just sex.  I want more than that with you."

Sage smiled.  "See, we have our own hang ups about this relationship.  I will slow down.  I want to explore everything with you."

I returned the smile.  "Good."  I nipped his neck, and the kissed it softly before pushing him away with a wide smile.  "What did your Dad want?"

Sage sighed, "It was work related.  I told him about you coming by, he told me to help you.  Said it could be linked with what I was working on."

"Ah."  I grinned at him, "Did you tell him he interrupted things?"

Sage blushed, and I chuckled as I packed the rest of breakfast away.  "No." He said.  "But I need to get home to work."

I nodded.  "I figured.  I'll see you soon."

Sage grabbed me by the waist and spun me towards him and kissed me thoroughly.  We broke apart breathless.  Sage smiled.  "That's to hold us over while we work."

I chuckled.  "I don't know if that will hold us over, but it's a start.  We might have to refresh it at lunch."

Sage grinned.  "I will see you soon, Nox."  He walked around the bar to the bed and pulled on his shoes.  I watched the fine movements of his fingers tying the laces.  He moved slowly.  He knew I was watching.  Sage looked up at me as he stood up and headed for the door.  He pulled the foil packs from his pocket and grinned before sliding them back in.  "We will use these someday soon."

I bit my bottom lip in anticipation.  I looked forward to that.  Sage stopped on the other side of the bar before my front door and leaned on it.  "One more?"

I laughed, but I closed the distance to my side of the bar and leaned across.  Sage met me half way and the kiss was soft and wet.  He pulled away still leaving me breathless.  "I will see you later."  Sage left with a grin.  I would see him soon.  I had time to grab a shower and before I needed to make Drake and my father breakfast.

I missed Sage, but I had things to do.  But when I got out of the shower I sent Sage a text.

> Me  
> 646-555-4512  
> Tue, 06/26/2015  
> ****  
> The shower was lonely without you.  
> 5:37 AM  

I was outside Kai's apartment door when I received Sage's reply.

> Mysterious blue eyed boy  
> 646-555-2915  
> Tue, 06/26/2015  
> ****  
> You are making me regret leaving early.  
> 5:47 AM  

I laughed as I knocked on Kai's door.  I heard little footsteps inside the apartment.  The door unlocked and opened.  My father was no where to be seen.  I sighed as I lifted the little dragon up.  He chirped, "Hi, Nox.  Poppi is still in bed."

"Drake, you can't answer the door without a big person all right?"

"Poppi told me too."  Drake chittered on about what he and Poppi did.

"Then I guess I'll be having a chat with my father about proper parenting.  And I'm the kid here."  I set Drake down.  "Go get ready for school.  I'm gonna go get Poppi up and have a chat."

Drake ran off to get his things situated while I walked down the hall to my father's bedroom.  The door was wide open, and it was dark inside. There were no windows to let in the little light outside.  My father didn't rate a window, it made me smile. I flipped the light on and my father groaned and covered his head.  "Kai, my child, a three-year-old cannot under any circumstances answers the door by himself.  He's three!"

Kai sat up and blinked.  "I knew it was you."

"And if it wasn't?"  I asked.  "I know it's been a while since you have had little kids, but they don't answer doors unless you are watching them."

Kai rolled out of bed.  "It won't happen again."

"Okay."  I said, and I left the room.

"You took that well?"  Kai laughed.  "I expected you to yell more."

"I'm learning as we go too, why would I be a dick about it?"  I asked.

Kai nodded.  "Because I wasn't there for you."

I smiled.  "I'm trying to be a better son.  I'm going to make breakfast."

Kai chuckled.  "You had me babysitting to get laid?"   Kai grabbed my chin and pressed his thumb against my neck just above my t-shirt collar.

I shook my head and laughed.  "No.  Walker and I went looking for a hacker.  Just turns out the hacker we were looking for was my boyfriend.  What can I say?"

My father went to his bathroom to shower, and I made breakfast.  It would be an interesting morning.  Drake climbed up on to the bar stool in Kai's kitchen.  I smiled at him as I set left over pancakes in front of him. "They aren't hot, but they are fresh."

He grinned and picked it up to eat with his fingers.  I asked him, "Are your things ready to go?"

Drake nodded.  "Yes, sir.  Poppi didn't let me make a mess."

"That's good."  I smiled.  "You want hot pancakes and eggs?"

Again Drake nodded.  "Yes, please."

I made sausage for everyone I wasn't sure what my father liked but since he ate in the cafeteria most days a home cooked meal is better than one there.

Eggs would be last - I hated cold eggs.

The pancakes were only a few, I made a couple for Drake and my father besides the ones Drake was eating while the rest of the food cooked.  My father didn't have a coffee maker - blaspheme.  I would have to rectify that.  I hadn't had enough coffee yet.  I sighed.

By the time the food was cooked my father was coming out of his bedroom wearing jeans and a t-shirt.  "Damn, I don't think my kitchen has ever smelled this good."

I sighed. "It'd smell better with coffee brewing."

Kai frowned.  "Sorry.  I grab a cup downstairs."

"I figured.  I'll have to grab a few more cups before I go meet my hacker."

"You mean your boyfriend." Kai smiled.

"He's that, too."

Drake asked, "Can Sage come by again?  I liked him."

"I'm sure he'll be back again soon, Drake.  I think he liked you too."  I smiled at the little dragon as he shoveled more food into his mouth.  I wondered if he was going through a growth spurt or if all dragons at this much. I was leaning towards the latter.

We ate in almost perfect silence.  But Kai did ask a few questions which I answered.  We didn't want to talk too much about work in front of Drake and we had little in common beyond that.

Breakfast was finished, and we were heading out the door.  It wasn't the best breakfast I'd ever had, but it was the first breakfast I had with my father.  It was the first solo meal we'd ever had.  And it went rather well all considering.

I dropped Drake off at school and Ant and Walker were just walking up outside my apartment.
