# Hunting in the City

Ever since my first hunt I had avoided working with anyone. It’s not that Michaela was a bad partner. We disagreed on everything. She was a kill first ask questions later type of girl. Most Venatori hunters were of the same mind. They didn’t care why a supernatural being was doing something. They put an end to the current law being broken and didn’t care about anything else.

No one cared when a vengeful ghost possessed a little girl and then went on a killing spree starting with their murderer, but I did. I tried to save the little girl in my first hunt, but it came down to my life or hers and I had to kill her with the ghost inside.  Later when I was out on my own, I could explore the reasons behind the ghosts actions. Turned out, an abused boy possessed the little girl.  His own father beat him and later killed him.  After killing his father, the ghost killed every other person who didn’t stop the abuse but knew about it, until I stopped him.

It wouldn’t have changed the outcome but there was a reason, maybe if I’d understood in the beginning I could have done different things. I tried to see things from their side because I was more on their side than any other side. I wasn’t Venatori - not fully anyway, and I wasn’t human either. The line that every hunter drew in the sand, I straddled it daily. But, I choose my path, and no one liked working with me because of it. I was okay with that.

Walker was no different. He eyed me up and down as we walked. I had no destination, but we walked. He turned to the elevators and pushed the button to go up. I took a deep breath and pushed the anxiety away.

We ascended 14 floors in the plate glass elevator that overlooked the middle of the AU Building. The height was dizzying as we moved up and even closing my eyes didn't stop the anxiety from rising the higher we rose.

When the door opened, I hurried out and Walker was chuckling. “Big bad hunter afraid of heights?”

I shrugged. “It doesn’t stop me from doing anything. I take it you are hungry?”

Walker nodded. “You mind if we work and eat at the same time? Or don’t you like to socialize, always choosing to eat in your apartment?”

He was being snide and condescending and it was something I was used to. “I socialize just fine.” With those I felt worthy of my time. Most people in the cafeteria were not.

The line waiting for their own food was short.  I grabbed a bottle of water, a banana and some yogurt left over from breakfast. It wasn’t quite lunch, but there was more lunch than breakfast being served.

A friendly face peaked over the hot serving line. “Hey, darling. Hold up. I got something for you.” Ms. Sheila's southern drawl was never quite removed from her personality.  It made me wonder if she exaggerated just for the sake of being different.  I know it was something I would do.

I raised my eyebrow in question as Ms. Sheila hurried off into the back of the cooking area to fetch something. Walker grinned. “You like them all sorts of ways don’t you.”

“I do.” I wouldn't let him get under my skin.

At that moment Ms. Shelia in her dyed pink hair - it was supposed to be auburn, but it always came out pink. She said she tried to fix it, but so many people loved it she kept it that way. That was shy of 15 years ago. She handed me a bag with a wink. “Don’t look at it until you leave the line.”

“Okay.” I smiled at her and then blew her a kiss which elicited a snicker and a giggle from Ms. Shelia.

“Always the charmer. I’m surprised Mia hasn’t found you a young lady to settle down with yet.”

I waved at her with another smile. “Oh, she’s trying.”

Walker was waiting for me at an empty table. The cashier scanned my ID, and the charges applied to my account for the day. But I’d gotten a free meal or something out of it. It was worth coming down to the cafeteria some days. Ms. Shelia enjoyed spoiling me.

I sat down in front of Walker and set my tray on the table while I put the bag in my lap to see what was in it.

Walker leaned over the table trying to grab a peak too. “You must be a good lay to get special treatment.”

“Ms. Shelia likes me, what can I say.” I said with grandiose voice. Ms. Shelia treated me like her own son. She looked after the small skinny kid who ate the same thing everyday at the same time. I was so bad as a child, Ms. Shelia made my plate before I got there, and putting new things on it for me to try.

It was one of those change a little at a time so I don’t freak out moments. The first time it happened I hyperventilated and passed out and Dae'lin took me to the infirmary where she later bitched at me for freaking out, which sent me into another attack and on and on for three hours until Dorian came and calmed me down. I was a fucking mess.

I’m not much better now, but now I know how to cope. I’m not five anymore.

In the bag was a large freshly baked loaf of bread, still warm from the oven.  I wasn’t a big carb eater but one of my weaknesses was fresh bread. The moist warmth radiating up from the bag made me wonder if Ms. Sheila knew I would be downstairs for breakfast, but it didn't matter.

I tore a piece off and offered Walker the piece he shook his head. “No thanks.” He made no snide remarks which surprised me. But I was thankful.

The cafeteria was loud and noisy and I ate the piece as Walker stabbed the canned vegetables that were likely very bland. I frowned. “I can make you better than that.”

He looked up and frowned at me. “So you do cook?”

“I do. I taught myself how when I was 10.”

“Why?”

“Because I needed more food, than I could get in the cafeteria.” In the middle of the last word my tray swooshed across the table. I looked up to the now towering black man over my side of the table. “Nice to see you too, Aaron.”  My voice dripped with sarcasm.

My former roommate looked over at Walker and frowned, “You buddying up with him?”

Walker grinned. “If I am. You gonna throw my tray across the table too?”

Aaron ignored me. “I don’t suppose so, why you with the fag?”  He grabbed the top of my head and messed my hair up in attempt to piss me off.

“Rivera assigned my case to him. "  Disdain and disapproval rolled off his tongue.  "He’s lead on the dragon robbery now. I’m sure she’ll get captured and tried and some other lucky guy gets to kill her instead of me.”

I interjected, “You could still kill her, if it all came down to it. Just make it a condition of working with me. I’m sure they’ll obliged you. Who likes killing a creature they’ve not had to hunt down, at least you volunteer and you did the work to get here there.”

Walker looked at me like I was crazy. I added. “I’ve never worked with anyone before there has been no one to make the claim. I don’t see why if she’s found guilty that you can’t do the deed. I’m not going to.”

Aaron laughed. “Wuss.”

I shrugged. “I can take your ass any day, Aaron.”

“Oh really?” He grabbed the back of my neck.

I wove a solid bar of air between me and Aaron and used it as a lever to bring him to the ground and I was on top of him as he landed, my knee on the base of his throat. He was looking up at me in with wide black eyes and I smiled down at him.

“Really.” I stood up and offered him a hand up. “I don’t have to play nice anymore, Aaron. Remember that.”

He slapped my hand away instead of allowing me to help him. He frowned at Walker and walked away from us.

Walker refrained from laughing until the big black bully of my youth was out of ear shot. “I will have to remember you don’t fight fair.”

“Do you plan on fighting with me?” I asked as I finished the bread in the bag since my sudolunch was gone.

He shook his head and blond strands fell over his gray eyes before he pushed it back into place. On another day he might be cute, but I didn’t mix work with pleasure.

“So. What do you have on your mysterious dragon?” I asked so we could begin the audious task of hunting dragons.

Walker pulled his laptop out of his bag.  After everything booted up he pulled up several files. “These are the photos we got of her using her fire breath. We have little more than these pictures.”

“You try to finger her for other robberies?” I asked.

“I did. Facial recognition was crap, she never looked at the camera. They did a good job casing it.”

“What did she take? Money? Stuff out of the safety deposit boxes?”

“Reports says she took nothing.”

“What?” I was confused now. “Nothing?”

“She put in a USB stick into all the computers and ran a program. In other cases she took the money from the drawer. But that was it. Other than she’s a dragon we could let the police handle her.”

“I’d like to know what they put in the system.”

“The human police won’t tell us anything.” Walker frowned. “They have a security group working on it. Won’t say who. Our contacts can’t get shit from them. Maybe it’s just cause I’m a newb. I don’t know.”

I got up and sat down next to Walker so we could both look at the laptop and loo at the pictures. She never looked at the camera, but her man had a leather jacket with a patch on it. “Did we get any good pictures of this here?” I pointed to it.

Walker shrugged. “I don’t know. Why?”

“I think I know the patch.” I frowned, if I was right this was not a good thing.

We searched the few images that Walker had, but there wasn’t much to go on. The image however got clearer in one and it was a patch I recognized. I pointed at the image. “Zoom in here?”

Walker looked at me with disgust. “What?” I asked. “It’s your laptop. I will not presume to use it.”

Walker smirked. “I figured maybe you didn’t know how.” He pushed the laptop my way.

I used the track pad to zoom in to the patch. I could make out the dragon head even though the picture was pixalated. “I’ve never seen it on a patch before. The Last Phoenix tattoo their skin or use brands. They don’t wear leather jackets. But they are very much like a biker gang.”

“The Last Phoenix?” Walker asked.

“A dragon gang. They are harmless - for the most part.” I stood up and closed the laptop lid. “Let’s go to the Archives. We can find out where they like to hang out.”

Walker put his things away and laughed, “What, you don’t know where they like to hang out? I thought you were tight with the monsters.”

“I wouldn’t say tight.” I grinned at him. “I have two friends who are supernatural in nature.”

We left the cafeteria, but I didn’t get far. A woman stopped in front of me, she looked back at her friends with a giggle and then back at me with her bright green eyes. I remembered her from school.  

She smiled at me. “Hi. That was a pretty cool move.”

I smiled. “Nothing special. What can I do for you?”

Her green eyes sparkled as she glanced back at her friends again who were nodding at her. “I bet you don’t remember me. I’m Beatrice Magellan.”

“I remember you Treec. You’ve lost weight. You look good.” Treec had been a large girl as a child. It was uncommon as a Venatori. Our metabolism prevented it. But some of us didn’t get the better part of the gene pool - to heavy on the human DNA.

Walker grabbed my arm. “Come on, let’s go. We have a job to do.”

“Soon as Treec asks me what she wanted to ask me.” I gave the girl with some nice curves a smile, “Well Treec?”

She blushed. “I was hoping we could talk over dinner sometime.”

“Talk about what?” I asked.

“I heard you were almost up on time… ” She paused and looked back at your friends yet again, then back at me like she as a blush crept up her neck and over her cheeks.

I couldn't help but grin while I waited for her to finish her question.

We stared at each other for several seconds. “up on what?” I asked with a mischievous smile.

She sighed and her blush grew deeper. “I heard you were looking for partners to um… have children.”

“I am.” I pulled my phone out. “How about Monday night at 6pm?”

Treec shrugged. “Really? I didn’t think you’d be interested…”

“Interested in you?” I asked, and she blushed again. “Why?”

She looked down and shuffled her foot against the floor before she spoke quietly, “I’m not your usual type.”

I took her hand and lifted it to my lips. “I don’t have a type, Duckling. 6pm on Monday. I’ll pick you up and we’ll go out.”

She nodded, and she turned redder as she turned back to her friends.

I started for the door and Treec’s friends all giggled as I walked by. I gave them a flourished bow as I passed them with a wink. The cafeteria was back to its original state. We left the noisy chaos.

Walker laughed as we walked out. “Why agree to meet with her?”

“Why not?”

Walker shrugged, “She’s not hot. I thought you could do better?”

“Better than what?” I asked. “She was in the top of her class. She’s an empath, that’s not a bad gift to have. And she’s full Venatori. Her family is related to the ruling houses through marriage. Her mother was a Haskins. But she’s got great green eyes, I'm sucker for eyes.”

“If you didn’t notice she’s rather large.” Walker smirked.

I groaned. “Really? She can’t be a good lay because she’s got more meat on her? You ain’t had enough sex Walker.”

He stuttered. “I. I. You don’t know anything about me. I’ve had plenty of sex. I’ve never had any complaints.”

“I’m sure you haven’t. A fine body like that has to have moves. But I’ve seen guys like you fail horrifically in bed.”

“Don’t get any ideas. I don’t roll that way.”  Walker sneered.

I laughed. “Most guys don’t. I would never hit on you unless I was one, out trying to pick up a guy, or two, you would seem to welcome my advanced.”

“You could tell I’m not gay?”

“What are your vibes about me?” I asked.

“I don’t know. You wear make up, but you don’t dress like a gay guy.”

“But I’m gay?”

“I guess. Though you said yes to a girl so I don’t know. I’m confused.”

I grinned, “Glad to confuse you. But honestly, I don’t really like the big macho men.” I smiled. “No offense.”

“You like the nerds?” Walker laughed.

I shook my head, “No, not the nerds per se. They don’t have to be brainiacs.”

In our chatting we managed the stairs down to the Archives and Walker hadn’t mentioned my avoidance of the elevator. Either he hadn’t noticed, or he didn’t care and would rather talk about the people I liked. Either way we were at the Archives door and Walker looked at it with concern. “We could have been here a few minutes ago. You manipulated me.”

I grinned as I pushed the wide double doors open. “It’s amazing what a distraction can do.”

The Archives were huge compared to the smaller library in the Academy. It had amazed me the first time I had walked into it with Dorian so many years ago. The front desk was in the middle of a two story circular room filled with shelves from floor to ceiling. I knew each of those books housed the continuous history of every Venatori and supernatural creature we had on record. The woman at the front desk knew what was in every single one of those volumes.

I leaned on the desk and smiled at the green eyed woman behind the counter. She had black hair that was graying. I knew her through her son, and you could clearly see the features Dorian had inherited from his mother. “I do not know why you married a face like Mr. Vega.”

The woman turned with a huge grin. “Probably, because you were too young.”

“I’ve been told I look like my father.” I said politely trying not to sound bitter about it.

“You do, darling. You may have your father’s eye color but your eyes are that of your mother. I see none of Kai in them.” Her eyes were sad. She knew my parentage, the way I grew up. Knew how I felt about my parents. She turned her attentions to the man behind me. “Walker, how is your mother these days?”

“She’s doing fine ma’am. Thank you for asking.” Walker smiled at Mrs. Vega and offered his hand.

“What can I do for you boys?” Mrs. Vega asked. “I rarely see the young ones, besides Nox that is,  come in here.”

“Your knowledge is invaluable, Mrs. Vega. This is your life’s work. Why wouldn’t I come get the answers from the one person who would know them? The computers are all well and good, but they don’t work as well as the Venatori memory in that pretty little head of yours. Dorian got his memory honest.”

Mrs. Vega shook her head, “What are you looking for today?”

“The Last Phoenix, they’ve been in the City for some time. The vampires are keeping tabs on them and I think the wolves too. When dragons come to town, the others know. I need…” Walker cleared his throat. “We need to find out where they might hang out. We think one of their numbers is pulling off bank robberies or they are helping someone else do them. Either way their symbol is on a jacket of one of the robbers. But I don’t think he’s a dragon. He has no shadows.”

“Shadows?” Walker asked.

“Nox, is not your ordinary run of the mill Magnus.” Mrs. Vega smiled.

“I know he’s Cesari.”  Walker declared proud of his knowledge.

“He’s more than that. What’s your gift, young Walker?” Mrs. Vega asked.

“I have infrared vision. It’s really annoying at times when I can’t figure out how to turn it off.”

“That could come in handy.” I interjected as I made note.

Walker asked with interest, “What’s yours?”

“I see patterns.” I shrugged. “The way things fall, the surrounding patterns that make up every object. Dragon’s have a shadow of their dragon form around them. I can see it, even in images. It’s pretty amazing that it comes through when Magnus ability doesn’t.”

Mrs. Vega slipped around the corner of the front desk and started towards the towering shelves. “I think I remember Hanley use to own a bar, the Last Phoenix use to use as a front. Hanley’s been dead going on 20 years now, but his son still runs the place.” She muttered to herself. “Ugly Deer Tavern.”

She climbed up the ladder attached to the wall and stepped up a few rungs and reached a book that had the same insignia on it. Mrs. Vega flipped through a few pages. “The Ugly Dog Saloon. "  She said tapping it in the book where she found it's listing.  "It’s on First Avenue between 8th and 9th. Or it was. But Derek seems to keep it up and running so I assume it’s still in the same place. He’s never filed a change of address.”

“Does Derek have a last name?”  I asked

“Montrey.”

“Thank you Mrs. Vega.” I said as she reached the ground. I appreciate it.

“You are welcome as always, Nox. Walker it’s a pleasure seeing you again, wish your mother my best when you see her. You boys take care.” And she was back to the front desk before we could even respond.

“It looks like we are going drinking tonight!” I said with a smile.

Walker just grinned back at me.
