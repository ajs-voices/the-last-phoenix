# Viva La Revolution

Walking around Hell's Kitchen was a bit nostalgic for me.  It was Adrian's territory and I used to walk around the neighborhood before and after sessions when I was avoiding my other lessons.  I'd grown a lot since I first roamed.

You could tell where the roan wolves holed up in Adrian's pack.  The area vibrated with power.  Human magic didn't vibe the same way.  But there were patterns to every magic.  And I let myself see everything.  Everything was made of elements - science agreed with me.  I could see each individual pattern.

A man walking past me was shrouded by his dragon form.  Humans and other Venatori couldn't see it.  But I could - it was my gift.  A gift that could make you sick if you didn't know how to control it.  It was partially the reason why I still went to therapy.  Seeing things was something I did on a regular basis and my gift was rare.  I needed verification in my thoughts and feelings upon some images.

I felt the power of a few wolves hanging out in on their front stoop.  They called out after me.  "You don't belong here Venatori."

I smiled and I let the power of Adrian's pack flow through me and I felt their power pulse and then die down in submission.  I could safely walk through Hell's Kitchen.  Adrian's power protected me.  Though Adrian said it was my power that did it.  He was only a means to a making it feel pack like.  The men outside the house whispered but I didn't bother with trying to listen.  They were not worth my time.

The air was warming up under the morning sun and I wove a cooling pattern around me as I walked.  There were pockets of dragon magic throughout the city, but here in Hell's Kitchen there was more than I was expecting.  Adrian ran a tight ship.  Did he know of the dragons?  I wished for Dorian's photographic memory but my mapping application on my phone was going to have to do that job for me.  I started mapping out the dragon pockets.  It could mean trouble, it could be nothing.  I had never tried to map the city this way before.  Maybe I should do it.

I walked and mapped until I received a phone call.  It was Sage.  I was glad I changed the ring tone.  "I'm sorry.  I know I'm late."

There was a rustle and then Sage spoke with a laugh, "It's two hours later than you said you'd be back.  But that's not why I'm calling.  I found your phone."

Two hours?  I frowned.  But Sage continued.  "I'm tracking it's location so I'll have it when you get here.  Are you alright? I'm sorry I forgot to send in the cavalry."

I laughed.  "You were busy.  I was busy.  No big deal.  But I'm glad I'm not the only absent minded one when working."  I turned towards Sage's apartment.  "I'll be there in about ten.  I'll call Walker and let Ant know Jack's debt has been paid."

"Alright.  I'll see you soon, Nox."  Sage hung up with little ceremony and I sent Walker a text.

> Me    
> 646-555-4512
> Tue, 06/26/2015  
> ****  
> Meet me at Sage's.  He found our dragon.  
> 11:21 AM  

I then dialed Ant's number.  

He answered.  "What's up?  You and lover boy done?"

I laughed.  "Actually yeah.  He found our dragon.  Thank you for your services."

"I didn't do anything except point you at your boy.  You want me to come along?"  Ant asked.

"It's best to keep the vampires out of dragon business for now.  But I suspect that this is bigger than we expected.  Emerson was in a vamp safe house.  The Dragon was using Val as a go between.  War is coming.  Let's not set Il Cane's side just yet."

Ant sighed.  "Call me if you need me Nox.  I will come at a mere thought if you open to it."

"I know, Ant.  I know. Gotta go."  I sighed as I hung up the phone.  The one downside to feeding a vampire was usually you were enthralled by them.  One downside to drinking their blood for healing benefits - you connected yourself to them.  Ant and I had done both over time and the connection was near permanent but we both kept it closed off.  Danger was one thing we both sensed from the other.  Hopefully it didn't get that far.

I was closer than I thought to Sage's apartment, I must have been walking around in concentric circles.  I knocked on the door before turning the door knob only to find Sage standing directly in front of me when the door opened.  He was grinning at me with a bright smile and those gorgeous blue eyes I loved so much.

"Hi."  I said.

Sage laughed.  "Hi.  Is Walker coming?"

I shrugged.  "I texted him.  I don't know if he was done with Dae'lin or not."

Sage took my hand and pulled me inside closing the door behind him then backed me up with his hands on my chest against the door. I hummed at him in question before he leaned down and kissed me deeply.  The kiss left my lips swollen and wet and I was breathless when he pulled away, my hands still in his as he walked backwards to his desk chair.  

He sat down with barely a glance backwards, his eyes never leaving mine.  He pulled me into his lap one leg on each side and my body pressed against his chest.  He grinned up at me and took a handful of hair and pulled me in for a kiss.  My jeans grew tighter.  I could feel Sage's arousal through our clothing and let out a soft growl.

The apartment door burst open with a red-face and I turned to see who had interrupted us.  Walker was coming in skidding to a halt when he noticed what we were doing.  He started to stutter before he turned and closed the door behind him.

I turned back to Sage who was a soft shade of red.  He chuckled up at me as I pressed a tender kiss to his forehead.  "One day we won't get interrupted."  I stood up and straightened my self out before continuing.  "I'll go get him."

Sage sighed but nodded his acceptance and turned to his computer to show us what he had found.

I opened the door and found Walker sitting on the steps leading down to the door.  He was still a little red.  I closed the door behind me, "You alright?"

Walker nodded.  "I guess I should have taken my time."

"It's alright.  If we kept at it you'd probably walked in on more than kissing."  I grinned playfully at him.

Walker covered his eyes and then his ears.  "I don't want to know."

I laughed.  Walker stood up and we went back inside.  Sage was speaking the moment he saw us both walking towards him.  "The phone's here.  It's been there for the past 5 minutes."

I took a set of comms out of my pocket. "I shouldn't do this, as you are a civilian, but I need your computer to tell me where we are.  Can you track my phone and Walkers?  And tell us when she moves?"  I handed Sage an ear bud. "We can all talk through these."  I handed Walker one as well.  I showed Sage how it sat in my ear with my own.  

Walker asked, "You just have a set of these lying around?"

I shook my head.  "Not lying around.  I had them from when I worked with my mother and Michaela.  Boulder never asked for things back."

Walker just laughed.  "That's why we are missing so much equipment."

"No they subscribe to a this is yours now policy.  Take care of it you aren't getting more."  I said.

Sage smiled.  "Yeah I can do that.  I've worked with Danny like this once.  I wasn't supposed to, I was 16 at the time."

I kissed the top of Sage's forehead and left his basement apartment office space.  Thankfully the phone was in New York City.  It was in Hell's Kitchen at the moment - stationary and hopefully doing her thing.  And by her thing I meant hacking.  I asked.  "Sage, can you get a status on your friends progress.  Is our hacker busy?"

I heard Sage's voice in my ear and smiled.  "I can do that."

Sage started typing away at his keyboard - or that's what I assumed the sound was.  Walker laughed.  "He's a typing machine."

I shrugged. "He does it for a living he should be good at it right?"

Walker nodded.  But Sage came back over the comms.  "They are still trying to fight the hacker."

"That's good.  Let us know if anything changes."  I said before moving on to our destination.

We moved through several different neighborhoods before we closed in on the signal.  This place was more run down than most of the other places we'd walked through.  Walker went around the back while I went in the front.  I let my senses drift around me.  I could feel the varying magics around me.  I could see the patterns of the world in front of me.  I could see and smell things that were not perceptible before.

The front door to the building was unlocked as I went in.  It creaked eerily as I pushed it open.  But there was no one and nothing but a long hall and stairs before me.  I whispered.  "Can you get an elevation on that phone?"

Sage spoke back clearly in my ear though it sounded little more than a whisper.  "Negative.  Software isn't that good.  I'll write a better one for next time."

"Got it."  I said.  "I'll go up, you check here and down Walker."

"Confirmed."  Walker said into his own comms.  

I went upstairs.  The floorboards squeaked with each step.  It didn't matter how quiet we were, this was a den of dragons.  I didn't dare draw my gun, but I formed a pattern in front of me that would serve as a shield or net as needed.  I just hope I didn't need the shield.  Things would end badly if it did.

Sage whispered over the comms.  "Nox, you are coming up on the signal to your right."

I moved to the door to my right and listened to the sounds on the other side.  I heard nothing.  I knocked on the door.  Still nothing.  I spoke loudly through the door.  "I'm going to open the door."

There was nothing.  Picking locks was easy with my ability.  It was one of the first skills I had learned when I started working in the City.  It's hard to hunt the monsters that think like a human if you can't get into places.

The door opened easily and I checked each room thoroughly before moving on to the next.  I checked under the couch for any sign of a phone or a computer.  Just in case they'd been left.

I looked through the cabinets, and closets.  Each room was empty.  The phone wasn't on this floor.

Walker had no luck on the first floor either, he was moving to the basement.  I was moving up to the third and last floor.

The third floor was empty as well.  The phone hadn't moved which meant Walker was in the correct place.  But we hadn't heard anything over the comms.  "Sage, how is Walker doing?"

Sage didn't answer.  Fuck!  I took the stairs all the way down.  I tried to raise either Walker or Sage but I couldn't get through to either of them.  They had to be jamming the signal now that we were there.  

I found the stairs to the basement and started down.  I made a ramp of air down instead of using the creaky planks going down.  I made no noise as my feet never touched the wood.  Another trick I had learned.  A little more difficult to maintain on a regular path, but stairs were easy.

The floor at the bottom was concrete.  It was old and cracked.  I heard voices coming from the other room.  There wasn't a lot of places they could be in here.  The basement was full of machinery that ran the building, generators, boilers, that kinda thing.  Not really a good place to hole up for hacking.

I moved slowly through the shadows.  Beyond the stairs entrance a door was closed and a thin bar of light shown through.  I heard chains rattle to my left and I turned in time to see someone bolting out to attack me but the chains hindered their movement.  There was blood dripping from his mouth, I could see tiny fangs protruding from his face.  A caged vampire...  What the fuck was going on here?

There was a loud noise inside the closed room and I heard a voice yell, "Someone else is here!"  Followed by the sound of a fist hitting flesh.  "You said you were alone."

My first thought was they had gotten Walker.  I wove air and fire in front of me, I would be ready for whatever came out of that door.  Walker stared back at me.  There was a bloody bit mark on his neck and a hand was holding a gun to his head from behind him.  A small hand held his belt buckle in front of him.  The nails were cut close to the finger like they'd been chewed on.  I could smell the fear radiating all around me.  The vampire was afraid now that the girl dragon had come out.  Walker feared for his life.  And he had every right to beleive he was going to die.  Vampire bites were fatal to Venatori.  Such a loss.  The girl behind him was even more afraid.

"Let him go.  He's dead anyway."  Fear opened Walker's eyes and I smiled at him to reassure him.  "He got bit.  You know Venatori die from vampire bites - wolves too."

She paused a moment.  I could almost feel the wheels turning inside her head.  I wish I could see more of her other than her hand and legs behind Walker's stance.  "You won't kill him."  she said confidently.  "I know who you are."

"Enlighten me." 

She peeked around Walker and I saw a deep brown eye lined with dark eye liner and mascara that was smudged, it looked like she'd been crying.  "You are local Venatori who doesn't kill innocents.  Everyone knows you."

"Woah!  I'm famous huh?" I grinned at her.  "Why don't we get on even footing and tell me who you are?"  I widened my smile.

She looked back at me with wide eyes contemplating the situation and her answer.  She shook her head, "You don't need to know my name."

"Okay.  I'll just call you Duckling then.  You need to let my friend go.  He's already in shock from the vampire venom.  He's going to die."

Walker added to my words.  "Just shoot me Nox.  Kill us both."  He looked like he was about to puke.  He was ashen and his eyes were watering and red.  He actually looked like he believed what he was say. But I had no intention of killing either of them.  

She looked back at me and frowned.  She pushed Walker away from me and pointed the gun at me.  Walker staggered away from her and crouched down with his hand to his neck.  I wove elements around his neck and stuffed the bite with elements like I had when I'd been bitten.  I don't know how long he'd been bitten.  Hell I didn't know if it'd work but I knew I had to try.  Walker didn't know the difference as he felt himself dying in the shadows of the basement.

I opened myself to Ant.  It was one of those things I could just feel.  I called him and hoped he could hear me.  It was still the middle of the day and he was weaker now with the sun nearly at it's peak.  But I couldn't worry about it.  I looked at the girl with a smile.  "Well, Duckling, that's better.  You and I can talk now."

"Why are you here?"  She asked.

"To stop you from what you are doing.  What are you doing?"

She shook her gun at me.  "I'm the one asking the questions.  How did you find me?"

"A friend of mine found you."

"I heard The Wicked Truth was helping the feds.  He lead you here?"  she asked.

I shook my head.  "I don't know any Wicked Truth. Is that some kinda code name?"  I asked with a grin.

"He's a white hat called Truth.  He was Wicked before he got busted.  He's been poking around.  He's the only reason why you'd find me.  Damn technopaths!"

Sage didn't even know he was a technopath, but this dragon did.  "Duckling, if you can keep The Wicked Truth from your game you must be pretty big on the playing field."

She laughed.  "I suppose.  You need to go.  I have to get back to work or he'll let him go."  She nodded towards the chained vampire.

I wrapped the vampire up in bonds of air and he looked at me with wide eyes as he could no longer move.  "Duckling, I'd worry about me and not this baby vampire."  I formed a flaming ball above my hand.  "See, I need you to stop harming the human world.  And I need you to come with me.  I don't want to kill you, but I will if I have to.  Emerson found that out the hard way."

The girl paled and the gun dipped just a little as she regained herself.  But it was enough of a slip that I had moved in and taken the gun from her with a quick move of my near human speed and my ability.  She was lying on the ground with my knee at her throat unable to breathe.  "You can't spit fire at me if you can't take a breath."  I smiled as I gagged the girl and got up with her hands still in mine.  "You need to come with me."

I spoke over the comms.  "Love, you can give the feds the location, but I'm taking the occupants.  Basement is will be clear of all danger to humans once I leave.  Walker is down, I need to get him to the Infirmary.  I'll be in touch."

Sage laughed.  "You really don't want to confirm who I am to our little friend?"

I shook my head but knew he couldn't see it.  "No, I don't."

"Danny, and a team are on their way to the location.  He said to leave the computer equipment."

"Done.  I will give him an update soon as we have a story to sell."  I sighed. "I'll catch you later."

In the shadows I felt a presence appear.  "Bout time you showed up.  Got a baby vamp for you to take care of.  I need to get Walker home.  He's been bit."

Ant looked over at Walker who was looking a little less pallid than before, maybe the resources were helping.  Maybe vampire bites didn't need to be fatal.  One could only hope.

I helped Walker up and took the dragon by the bonds of air and dragged her with me.  Ant took the vampire by his elbow and it instantly calmed down.  "Hey Nox.  Let me get you home faster."

I frowned but nodded.  "Okay."

He grabbed my elbow with his other hand and we shadow walked into the alleyway behind the AU Building.  A place I knew well.  I jumped into the very alley way on many occassions.  It was seculded even on the most sunny days.  Ant frowned at me as i bent over trying to keep what little I'd eaten down.  "Thanks, man.  Let me know what's going down.  The Council and Elders won't be happy once they find out the dragons had one of us chained up and starved."

"I will let you know Ant.  Thanks for the ride."  I grinned.

Ant chuckled as he stepped back into the shadows and was gone.

After we all recovered we were inside and in headquarters via the service elevators we'd brought Naomi and Gordon in on.  It was almost deja vu except Walker was still not up to par.

"Go to the Infirmary.  I got this part.  I'll be there when I'm done."

Walker didn't even hesitate as I got off on the right floor and he continued on up.

The floor was quiet.  Oddly so.  I walked with the girl dragon in front of me in her gag and bonds and she looked defeated.  "If you cooperate you might make it out alive."  I doubted it.  I'd not seen any of my captures freed after a trial.  A few had been sent to their own kind to be dealt with but it was usually just as harsh a punishment as we'd dole out - death was the common cure for all things malevolent in the supernatural world.

I took the girl to the fishbowl and shut her in with a wall of air before knocking on Dae'lin's door.  She opened the door and frowned at me.  "Another one?"

"We need answers.  She might help.  Emerson wasn't going to talk.  I didn't give her the option yet."  I said flatly.

Dae'lin sighed.  "Go talk to her."

I did as I was instructed and let down the wall of air to enter and promptly replaced it.  I unwound her gag but not the bonds.  "Just kill me."  she said once her mouth was free.  "That's what they are going to do anyway."

I took a seat opposite of her. "You possess a skill we could use.  You seem keen on breaking the law for The Dragon.  Help us find him, maybe they'll let you out on a short leash if you work for us."

She laughed.  "Doubtful, you don't use other species for help." 

I smiled. "They don't, but I know a vampire who does.  Il Cane actually likes to have options.  She needs Chevalier to keep her from the technological advances. But she hunts just the same as I do."

"You know too many hackers for being daft."

I laughed.  "Call me lucky.  I know too many vampires and werewolves too for being Venatori.  I get around, what can I say?"  I grinned at her brushing my crimson painted fingernails against my shirt clearly bragging.

She rolled her eyes at me.  "What do you want?"

"I need The Dragon's location."

"I don't know where he is.  I've never met him.  Only that rat wolf Valentino."  She said.

"Well Duckling.  Can you find him?  He had to contact Valentino some how didn't he?  We've not uncovered that yet. Can you get all the calls to Valentino's cell?  You have his number."

"Why don't you get The Wicked Truth to do it or Chevalier if you know them."  She spit out at me.

"Because I'm asking you.  See, they are all on good standing with me.  You, not so much.  I'm giving you a reason to get into my good graces."

She sighed.  "Fine.  Give me a computer."

"I'll get you a computer and a watch dog.  I can't have you telling The Dragon we are coming for him."

"Fine."  she said.  "Can you untie now?"

"Not right now.  But when everything's in place I will."  I stood up and walked out.  I pulled out my phone and I called Sage.  

He promptly picked up, "Nox! I didn't expect to hear from you so soon."

"I missed you too." I grinned.  "Can you come to the AU building.  I need you to watch the girl while she tracks down The Dragon for me."

"I could do that for you without the babysitting."  He sounded hurt.

"I know you could.  But she knows The Dragon.  She'll know what she has you might not.  I've plenty of things you can work for me that I'd trust you with before her.  If you are interested in more than babysitting."

Sage nodded.  "I don't think your bosses will like you giving me work."

I laughed.  "I don't care.  I need to you bring a bare bones powerful laptop.  Something she can use but she can't do much more on."

"I can do that.  But she can install anything she wants."  

"I got you watching her."  I smiled.  "Come to the twenty-ninth floor and someone will bring you to me if I can't get there."

"See you soon."  Sage hung up and I was left with a little dead air before I went about the rest of my walk.

I took the stairs up the two flights to the Infirmary to find Walker.  He was my next priority.

There was a woman at the nurses station out front and I stopped to ask her.  "Do you know where Walker Moore is right now?  He came in with a vampire bite."

Her face paled and she looked up from what she was doing.  "I'd gather he's in the morgue now."

"Can you look please?  He came in alive."  I asked slightly annoyed and letting it show in my face and my voice.  

She sighed and rolled her eyes but looked in the system and gasped.  "He's in ICU, room 236."

"Thank you."  I smiled at her and flourished her a bow.

I didn't wait to see what her reaction was as I turned around and went up to the next floor.  I was immediately stopped by a nurse, "Who are you here to see?"

"Walker Moore."  I said with a smile.

"Only family can see him here."  She pointed at the door, "And you are not family."

"He's my partner, come on.  I just want to check on him I won't be long."  I pleaded.

She took pity on me.  "Alright.  Where you there when he got bit?"

I shook my head.  "We'd split up.  I saw him afterwards, while he was being held hostage."

"He's right in there.  Don't be long."  She scowled as she left.

Walker was wearing a paper gown and sitting up in bed with an IV bag strung up next to him.  He wasn't dead - he looked better than last I'd seen him.  He nodded towards the door, "Shut the door."

I complied with a question written all over my face.  He quickly waved me over and whispered, "Did you do something after she let me go?  I mean to me."

I nodded.  "Yeah what I did the last time I got bit by a vampire.  Fed the wound elements.  Why?" I grinned at him.

"They say that I should be dead.  But here I am.  You made me a freak of nature."  He laughed.  "So this is how it feels like huh?"

I grinned.  "I suppose.  I didn't heal you.  You healed you.  I gave your body the resources to produce the antibodies needed to counter act the vampire bite faster than the poison could attack your system.  At least that's my theory."

Walker waved a hand over his head.  "Yeah, I so don't get it."

"You are going to be okay? I was worried." 

Walker nodded.  "Yeah, thanks to you.  You need to make a report on this.  Write a white paper or whatever they call them and submit it to the Venatori medical journals.  Cesari could be doing so much more than just being Scrin and teaching.  It opens up doors."

I shrugged.  "I don't know if it has to be Cesari.  Four single elemental could potentially yield the same results."

"I'll be okay.  Go back to whatever you were doing."  Walker said.

I laughed.  "I'm waiting The Wicked Truth to arrive so he can babysit the hacker girl.  She's going to find The Dragon for us."

"Why didn't you let Sage just do that for us?"

I smiled.  "I have something else in mind for him."

"Like what?"  Walker asked curiously.

I smiled again.  "Like cleaning up the mess we made.  If he does a good job maybe we'll use his abilities more often."

Walker laughed.  He almost feel out of the hospital bed he was laughing so hard.  "Making it so he has to see you huh?"

I grinned.  "No.  I think he'd enjoy a little more secrecy to his job than working for the government strictly.  He's like us.  What would you do if you got stuck with a desk job?  That's basically what he's doing.  And he's a technopath.  He needs the right outlet."

Walker shook his head. "You are too practical.  Why can't you just admit you want your boy toy around all the time."

I laughed.  "While that is 100% correct, I do want him around.  He's not my boy toy and I want to make him happy.  He loves doing what he does.  I can give him more of that."

I moved towards the door.  "I should go."  I opened the door and stepped out.  "Your nurse wasn't too happy I showed up not being family and all." 

Walker nodded.  "Don't go killing anyone without me."  He grinned.  "And think about that paper.  I'm sure Vega can give you some pointers on that."

I sighed.  "I'll think about it."

When I got back to Dae'lin's office and the fish bowl Sage was talking with Dae'lin in her office.  I stood outside the open door half listening but mostly watching Sage gesture with his hands and speaking quickly.

Dae'lin waved for me to join them and Sage turned to who she was beckoning and his face light up with a smile.  I grinned back at him.  I reached for Sage's waist and lightly hung my thumb on his back pocket.  "What can I do for you Dae'lin?"

"Your friend..."  She looked out my arm behind him and then turned to look up at me with a small blush on her cheeks.  "He was just informing me he couldn't make the changes we need."

"What changes are those?" I asked.  I had every intention of talking Sage into helping us frame Emerson for the hacking, but I had every intention of doing it with finesse and not bludgeoning him over the head like Dae'lin was prone to do with me.

"The human authorities need a fall guy, we have a dead man.  We need the two linked together.  I figured if you trust him enough to watch the dragon do a job, then he's trust worthy enough to do that."  Dae'lin said.

"He is.  But I'm sure you tactfully put it and just didn't say here's what you need to do?"  I rolled my eyes.

I pulled on Sage's pocket.  "Let me talk to him."

Sage laughed. "I am standing right here you know."

I kissed his check.  "I know.  Come with me beautiful."  I winked at Dae'lin and took Sage out of her office and into a quieter hallway.

He was looking at me with an amused look, the sparkle in his eyes told me he was interested in what I had to say.  I leaned against the wall with one shoulder and crossed my arms in front of me.  I wanted to touch him, which meant that would be a bad thing right now.  I needed to not persuade him with sex.  This wasn't about us.

He laughed and mimiced my pose.  "Okay.  Speak then."

"Dae'lin told you what needed to happen?"  I asked.

"Yeah.  I can't do it.  I'll get fired - then I'll go to jail."  Sage said flatly.

"If I can work around that for you?"

"How are you going to do that?"  Sage asked incredulously.  "You don't have that kinda clout here, what makes you think the US government is going to just let you do this?"

"Sage, love, we've been doing this for countless millennia - hiding in the shadows is what we do.  I can get you authorized access to get into secure servers."

"If you have that access why me?  Why jeapordize my freedom?"  He was getting angry.

"You like what you do?"  I asked.  "White hatting companies firewalls, finding the holes and then reporting it?"

Sage frowned.  "It's legal work."

"Is that what you want?"  I asked.

"You are asking me to break the law."  Sage said.

"I am.  Human law."  

"I am Human."  Sage spat at me.

"So am I but I'm not too.  Which is the same for you."  I said softly.  "You were raised by wolves.  You're a technopath.  You are of our world just by that alone, but Danny found you and he raised you as a wolf."

"So?"

"The Clandestine Providence governs human law even though human's don't really know it.  It is our job as gifted beings to protect the humans.  What do you think would happen if the humans find out that a dragon who runs a gang is trying to make humanity fall?  Or that the finest research facilities in New York City - the same ones who are searching for a cure for cancer - are run by supernatural creatures who feed on human blood.  Il Cane is not just the vampires enforcer - she funds things for humans.  The Night Life building is centered around vampires getting services needed to live a human life - but humans on the night shift benefit from it as well."

I sighed.  "I know I'm asking a lot of you.  I'm asking you too choose a side.  Join me, us, in protecting humanity or live in the ignorance that you were once part of."

"You can't make me forget any of this."  Sage said.

"No, I can't.  But I know someone who could.  I know someone who could erase your life with Danny and Rosie and give you a normal human one.  No wolves, just your path ability.  I can't take that from you.  We can give you the life you want without any of this shit.  It's rare that we do this.  But we can."

Sage sank to the floor, "Why can't I just stay this way and not work for your people."

I sat down next to him.  "I don't think you could handle the ramifications of my life.  I wouldn't be able to stay in your life.  I can't protect you in your world.  Erasing me from your life would probably save you a lot of heartache."

"I don't know about that.  Forgetting you could be devastating."  Sage joked but it was laced with venom.

"I'm sorry.  I should never have asked you to do this for me."  I stood up.  "Thank you for the laptop.  I'll have someone else babysit."    I started to walk away feeling broken inside.

Sage called out, "Nox."  I stopped but I didn't turn around.  He sighed.  "Would you give up everything to be with me? Would you pretend to be human for me?"

I took a deep breath and nodded. "I would.  And I can. If it means you'll stay with me forever."  I walked forward and turned the corner.  I could feel the anxiety level rising from the question.  I'd thought about so many times and the anxiety always made me cringe in fear.  I wanted to get away from it away from the question and the answer.  I needed some fresh air I couldn't breathe.

I was almost to Dae'lin's office when I felt Sage grab my arm.  He turned me violently around.  "You would give up all this for me?  To be something you aren't?"

I nodded.  "I would.  And I can.  All I have to do is exile myself from the Venatori.  I can't come back.  My children can't come back without jumping through major hoops.  I can forfeit everything I know and live a human existence.  Others before me have done it."

"What would you do?"

I shrugged.  "I dunno.  Go to college get a degree?  I could be a cook or a fitness trainer.  I don't have any formal training in any of it but I could do what needed to be done if someone was there to help me start out."

"You've thought about it before haven't you?"

I smiled.  "Every time Aaron throws my tray across the table, and every time someone thinks me bringing in the monsters is a wrong thing.  So it's a pretty weekly thing for me."

Sage asked.  "Would you do it for me?"

"Would you?  Give up everything for me?"  I smiled softly at him, "I'd give my life to make you happy Sage.  So giving up my world is nothing."

"Why would you do that?  We hardly know each other?"

I took a deep breath.  "Because I learned to trust my gut a long time ago.  You brighten my day just by being near.  You see me.  Not the image I put out.  You see around it.  It doesn't scare you.  I need that.  I need you.  Leaving you is going to be hardest fucking thing I've ever done in my life."  I turned and walked away again.

Sage fell into step beside me and took my hand.  "I'll help you.  It's not illegal if you have access."

I shook my head.  "No, Sage.  It's alright.  It's selfish of me to want you to do this.  I get it now.  I'm not going to ask you to choose between me and that.  I'd like you to babysit her.  But that's all.  I won't ask you to do something you don't want to do if you don't ask me to what we just talked about."

Sage laughed and stopped.  He pulled me in against his body with a smile.  "That's a deal."  He pressed his lips over mine and I sank into his embrace.  I let out a little whimper and collapsed against him.  He caught me and the kiss broke, "You okay?"

I could feel Dae'lin standing outside her door waiting for my answer.  I nodded but I couldn't say anything.  

Dae'lin spoke softly, "Bring him in here.  He just had a panic attack.  He'll be fine."
