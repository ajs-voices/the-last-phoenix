# The Rest of the Plan

I walked a small distance behind Walker and Emerson but we didn't walk much farther when I saw Emerson take a deep breath.  I saw fire pull in from the elements around him and build in his chest.  It was like watching a slow motion reel in the movie theater.  I threw a wall of air between Walker and the dragon about to rain hell upon my partner.  The second it solidified the fire was beating against it.  And in the next the dragon was lying on the ground, his neck wrenched to the side with a weave of air and his green eyes were glazed over and fading into their dragon form.

Walker turned and looked back at me.  His eyes were wide and his jaw fell slack.  I smiled and wove a veil around us as we dealt with a dead dragon.  I gave Walker a small smile and knelt down next to Emerson and sighed.  "I don't think we'll get any information out of him now."

Walker just stood and watched as I crafted air bonds to carry the now dead dragon to head quarters for proper treatment.  I would have handed him over to the dragons, but since he was a criminal he was Venatori's to do with as they desired.  His body would likely go in the incinerator.  But you never knew what they would do.

By the time we got back upstairs to headquarters I was drained.  My magical ability wasn't a determent to me unless I was forced to take a life with it.  It pulled life from me each time I defended myself with it.  It required balance.  And it looked like this mission was going to take a toll on my ability.

Walker was walking slowly by my side as we took the stairs all the way to the top.  He wasn't panting or even breathing heavy, which was a testament to Venatori strength and stamina.  We reached the landing of the hunting offices and Walker put his hand on my arm before I reached the door.  He smiled and said, "Thank you."

"There is no need to thank me.  I would have done it for anyone in the same position.  It's my job to protect the innocent."  I smiled back as I leaned against the wall for support.

"You look like shit," he said.

"Killing takes a while to recover from in a literal and metaphorical sense."  I couldn't explain to Walker something he wouldn't understand.  I couldn't explain Life essence to him because Life was not something we were taught, yet it still lived in the patterns we created every day.  It was how I could heal.  And killing destroyed life essence, I'd hurt myself in the process of taking Emerson's life.  And my body needed to recover from it just like any other injury.  It was all about balance and I had disrupted it.

Walker frowned. "Why do you do it then?"

I shrugged.  "It's faster.  I deal.  And also why I don't kill often."

"A gun would have worked just as easily."  Walker's conviction echoed in the stair well.

"How do you explain a gun shot with no body?  Or stray bullets?  I can control every aspect of my ability.  I'm more comfortable with it."  I sighed.  

"Maybe that's why no one uses their ability like you?"  Walker asked.  It was a rhetorical question, but I shrugged anyway.  I doubted anyone even thought that it affected you in that way.

We hadn't even made it to Dae'lin's office before the short raven haired woman stormed around the corner and stomped to a stop in front of us.  "I thought the object was to capture him alive?"

Walker laughed. "Because he attacked me.  I would have been a barbecued Venatori if it were not for Nox's quick thinking."

Dae'lin sighed.  "Your next plan?  The only other contact was connected to a Voice over IP account that bounced all over the world.  We can't track it.  It'll take days."

I smiled. "I'll send it to Ant. Jack can look at it.  He's a far better hacker than anyone in our employ."

"Because he's a path."  Dae'lin frowned. "Why do you keep using favor's Nox?"

"I don't do favor's Dae'lin.  I pay for services rendered."  

"What will you pay Wynn?"  Dae'lin asked.

"I won't pay Jack anything.  I will pay whatever Cari wishes to ask for."

"Nox, you can't afford this."

"What makes you think I can't afford whatever Il Cane will ask of me?"  I asked curiously.

"How much will it cost you?"

I shrugged.  "Maybe a pint or so of blood, maybe it'll cost me working a vamp case with Ant, or Tony.  It could cost me a favor to be extended later when she needs it.  With Cari I really have no idea what she'll ask of me to use Jack."

"Is it safe Nox?  She is not stable."

I smiled. "Dae'lin, any random person here in the Venatori is more likely to hurt me than Cari Giovanni is."

I pulled my phone out of my pocket and dialed Ant's number.  He answered on the first ring.  "What do you want?"

"Same thing I always want."

"What's that?"

"To take over the world Pinky."

Ant laughed.  "Do you ever get tired of that joke?"

I smirked, "Nope.  But I do need something."

"You always do. How can I help you, Nox?"

"I need Jack's help.  Any chance he's in town?"

"He's not in town.  He's with Cari in Italy.  And no Internet connection.  He's going insane."

"That sucks.  But give him my sympathies."

Ant added after a few moments of silence.  "He gave me a name and place I can get Truth if I need a hacker.  I'll send you the name, but he won't work with anyone he doesn't trust."

"And he trusts Jack?"  I asked.

"Jack trusts The Wicked Truth and told me how to gain his trust.  Or how to blackmail him if I had to."

"Blackmail is hardly necessary.  But I'd appreciate your help, Ant."

"I'll pick you up at 8 tonight and we'll go find Truth."  Ant said.

"I have a partner on this one.  That alright?"

Ant laughed.  "That's a new one."

"We'll see you tonight."  I hung up after Ant agreed.  

Walker sighed, "Another late night?"

"Looks that way."  I said.  "I'm gonna get my a few things done then we'll go with Ant at 8."

I headed to my room for a shower.  I could have called Sage, but I figured that would be pointless.  So I sent him a text instead.

> Me  
> 646-555-4512  
> Mon, 06/25/2015  
> ****  
> Have a late night again.  Working Late.  
> 1:05 PM  

My shower was quick and I called Treec.  She answered quickly.  I didn't even bother counting the rings I expected to go voicemail anyway.  "Hello?"

"Hey Treec.  This is Nox. I was hoping we could move our dinner to a bit earlier.  Five good?"

"Yeah sure.  I'll get off work at 4:30 so I can meet you at your place at 5."  She sounded excited.  I wasn't I was fucking nervous.  Thought I don't know why, this wasn't a date.

"Alright.  See you at five."

I had to find a baby sitter for Drake.  I'd almost forgotten about that.  Not that the Venatori care, but I did.  Drake couldn't stay home by himself there were laws against that - at least human ones.  

I walked down to the Academy to find Dorian.  I could have called but if he was busy I didn't want to interrupt him.  I found him in his office tapping away at his keyboard and staring at the monitor of his computer doing whatever it was that he did when he wasn't testing kids or creating a curriculum for them.

I knocked on the door and he called out, "Enter."  I opened the door and Dorian looked up and smiled at me.  "Nox, what can I do for you?"

I grinned at him as I sat down in the seat.  It hadn't changed any since the first time I'd sat in it.  "It's been a while since I've been in here."

Dorian nodded.  "Last time was when I told you who your father was."

I nodded with the memory.  "I know.  I was mad at you for keeping the secret from me.  For letting me hate a man who I had adored my whole life."

Dorian sighed.  "I am sorry about that.  But it was your mother's wish that you not know who your father was.  She was your guardian I couldn't disobey her even if she never took active part in your life, she was your mother, and she will always be that."

I stared blankly at Dorian.  I hated when anyone defended the woman that had given me birth.  I truly did not like the woman.  "I was hoping you could pick up Drake after school.  I have to work with Walker again tonight."

Dorian frowned.  "I'm sorry I can't.  I have a date."  The latter was said in a hushed whisper.

I had never heard Dorian say he was going on a date.  I knew he dated, but it was rare that he actually said so openly.  He was more like I was when I was younger, he choose to date outside the Venatori - it was safer and easier that way.  I wanted very much to say something but I held my tongue and nodded.  "Okay.  I'll find someone else to watch him.  You have a good time."  I stood up to leave.

Dorian chuckled.  "That's all you have to say?"

I shook my head.  "No.  Dorian it's not.  But I'm going to leave it be and be a bigger man than usual."

Dorian out right laughed.  "Your father could probably watch Drake for you.  He's been asking me how to approach you about being a grandfather to the little dragon.  He does feel guilty for not being there for you.  Why don't you let him be there for Drake."

I took a deep breath.  "Is this more than a suggestion?" I asked.

Dorian chuckled.  "Take it however you need to to ask your father for a favor."

"This is something you want me to do then?"

"Yeah.  I think you need to do it." Dorian said.

"Alright.  I will ask my father."  

I opened he door and before I stepped through Dorian added, "He's in his apartment he's probably cleaning up a little."

I turned around.  "You knew I'd ask you?"

Dorian smiled.  "Dae'lin called.  Told me the deal.  Informed me you might forget about your three year old roommate - her words, not mine.  And that I needed to make arrangements."

I sighed.  "So he was staying with Kai no matter what."

Dorian shook his head.  "No.  I knew you wouldn't forget.  But I let Kai know you would be taking my recommendation.  He was excited."

I rolled my eyes and Dorian laughed.  I pointed my finger at my mentor with a mock glare, "You played me."

Dorian nodded.  "I did.  I learned from the best."

I stuck my tongue out at him and heard Dorian laughing as I shut the door behind me to find my father.   Despite his fame and glory my father lived on the same floor as I did but in a better apartment.  His was like Dorian's and actually had a bedroom and a separate livingroom and kitchen.  It was a true apartment.  I knocked on the same door like my own and Dorian's.  

My father answered in a pair of sweats and a baseball cap.  He frowned as he saw me standing in the hall.  "Nox."

"Hi Dad.  I have a favor to ask you."

Kai moved to the side and let me inside.  His apartment was plainly painted.  There were a few pictures on the wall.  They were too far to see what they were of but I expected they were of my siblings and their families.  

Kai moved back into the kitchen and started washing dishes - again.  "What did you need Nox?  I'm kinda busy."

I grinned as I leaned across his bar to watch him.  "I have to work tonight.  I don't know when I'll be home.  I need someone to watch Drake for me.  I was hoping you might be able to.  Could do some grandfatherly bonding."

"He really talked you into asking me?"  Kai asked as he turned to look at me while he was holding a sudsy plate in his hands.

"He didn't talk me into anything.  He gave me another option and I agreed that it would be a good idea."

"Yeah, right?  Why would you let me watch this kid if you think of him like a son?"  Kai sneered but he went back to his dishes and I couldn't see his expression any longer.

"I can't let my personal feelings get in the way of family.  I hated you for so long, you have to let me sort those feelings out."

"You've had almost 4 years to do that."  Kai said plainly - the hurt in his voice was apparent.

"Maybe if you stopped treating me like some errant kid things would go better.  I am trying.  I'm here aren't I?  We sparred earlier.  I am trying Kai."  I laughed.  "Besides, I'm still dealing with my mommy issues and she left me when I was five.  I still haven't worked through that.  At least you are here trying with me."

Kai pulled the plug on his dish water and turned around.  "I guess you are right.  Margo says pretty much the same thing."

"I'll never get over the fact that you are dating my therapist." I smiled at him.  "So will you watch him for me?"

Kai laughed. "Why do you think I'm cleaning?"

"I didn't want to mention it.  Thank you."  I offered him my hand and Kai shook it firmly.  "I'll make you breakfast as payment.  I'll be by in time to feed you and Drake and get him to class on time."

Kai nodded.  "Sounds like a plan.  I have nothing here - not even coffee."

"Thanks for the heads up.  You know when to pick him up?"  I asked.

Kai smiled, "Dorian or Mia will drop him off here when he's out of class."

"Thanks again."  I said before leaving my father's apartment.  It felt weird but oddly enough it was what felt right.  I hope Drake didn't pick up on my resentment of my father.  He deserved a proper family.

After visiting my father I took a nap.  It was unlike me, but I needed sleep now or I'd not be able to function later when it mattered.  Balance needed to be restored.  The one good thing about naps is no nightmares.  It was refreshing sleeping during the day when I was supposed to.  Three hours later I woke up bright eyed and bushy-tailed as they say.  I cleaned my apartment up and started making dinner at half past four.  

At promptly 5pm there was a knock at my door.  The smell of white wine and garlic sauce permeated my apartment.  It smelled wonderful.  I took a deep breath before opening the door.  Beatrice Magellan stood in my door way wearing a long brown trenchcoat.  Her make up was perfect and her hair was pulled away from her neck in a high ponytail that fell in ringlets.  Her green eyes sparkled as I let her into my apartment.

She looked around and sniffed at the air, "Smells great."  But there was a nervous sort of tilt to her voice.

I smiled at her to take the edge off.  I wasn't wearing anything special, but she seemed like she wanted to keep the coat on.  I asked, "Can I take your coat?"

She shook her head.  "No."  Treec said as she pulled her coat tighter around her.  

I frowned.  I didn't like this, she wasn't making herself comfortable.  What could possibly be under the coat.  I went into the kitchen to start plating food.  "Would you like some wine?"  Maybe it would loosen her up a bit.  We were just going to talk, there was no need for discomfort.  It's not like I planned on seducing her.

"No."  Her voice sounded right behind me and I turned around to find the girl I'd gone to school with completely naked save for the brown trench coat that hung from her elbows.  I did my best to keep my gaze on her eyes, but I'm a weak man and my eyes scanned the woman before me.  She was curvy and plump but nothing unattractive about it.  When my eyes met hers again she lunged at me and pushed me up against the counter and started kissing me.  Her body was cool against my hands as I tried to understand what the fuck was going on.

I pushed her away from me, but she was Venatori, the most I did was give her a little more friction to rub against my leg.  I pulled back and hit my head against the cabinet.  "Treec.  Stop!"

She blinked back at me.  All the ferocity of the advance was gone in that instance as she stared back at me.  "You don't like me then."

"What does like have to do about any of this.  What are you doing?  I thought we were going to talk about what we wanted before we got to this stage."  I said flatly.

"I thought that was you just being polite.  Everyone knows you are just some whore looking for you next fuck."  Beatrice declared as a matter of fact.  "I want to have your baby what do we have to talk about?"

"A lot.  Like do you want to raise the child?  Do I?"

"Who the fuck cares?  I need to have a baby.  You need to have a baby.  What else matters."  She frowned at me. "I'm too fat, that's it isn't it?"  She sounded pissed.

"Your looks don't factor into anything.  I care who raises our child."

"You turned out just fine in the community pool.  I don't want to be a mother.  I just want this over with so I can get on with my life."

I sighed.  "So you thought you'd seduce me with a naked body and what you'd get pregnant the first time, and then you'd grow this child inside you and then what?  Throw it away.  Let it live a life without a mother or a father?"

"I'm not throwing it away.  I just can't raise a child.  And you don't seem like the fatherly type."

"Fuck you.  You know nothing about me!"

She sighed.  "That's what I was trying to do.  I'll go.  Since you aren't interested."

I let Beatrice Magellan walk out of my door before I collapsed to the floor of my kitchen with my head in my hands and my knees pulled up against my chest.  What the fuck just happened.

It wasn't the first time a girl had been aggressive.  It's how my first time happened to begin with, but this was the first time I hadn't wanted it to happen.  Hadn't been in the head space for it.  

I sat on the floor until there was a knock at my door.  I unfolded myself from the floor and then picked up my phone from the counter and glanced at the time.  It was 8 already.  I hadn't even changed.  I answered the door and let whoever it was in.  I didn't even wait to see - it was either Walker or Ant.  It didnt' matter as I headed into the back area where I could grab a clean button down shirt to pull over my t-shirt.  

Footsteps entered and shut the door behind them.  "You smell of fear, Nox.  What's wrong?"  I hated when someone knew something was wrong and particularly when they smelled the fear on me.  But when you have a vampire who can feed on emotions around it's hard not to reek of emotions.

I shrugged.  "Nothing I want to talk about, Ant."

"Your friend ditch you?"

I turned to Ant after pulling a red button down from the hanger.  "No, Walker's just not here."

"What's wrong?"  Ant asked again.

"Nothing."  I said flatly.

Ant advanced on me in a blur of vampire speed and was pushing me up against the wall with one hand in the middle of my chest.  "What's wrong?"

The words fell out in a whisper, "A girl tried to have sex with me and I pushed her away."

Ant was frowning at me.  I leaned forward so I wasn't pressed against the door anymore and he let me move.  I was thankful, I didn't want to have a panic attack.  "She wanted to make a baby.  Wanted to get her duty over with.  She assumed because I've had many partners that I would just fuck her."

"That's not what's upsetting you."  Ant said softly as he watched me take a drink of the wine in the glasses I had started pouring.

"She called me a whore."  I sighed.  "I don't know why it bothred me.  I've been called a whore before, I've been called worse things.  But she said I wasn't the fatherly type.  Like she knew I wouldn't be a good father."

Ant frowned at me.  "Dude, she doesn't know a damn thing about you."  Ant was standing next to me plucking the wine glass from my hand.  "I'm hungry."

I held my wrist for Ant.  "I fed Armand earlier.  And I killed a dragon.  Though I did nap so I should be good."

Ant sighed.  "Another time?"

I shook my head.  "No, I'd rather not owe your mother another favor."

Ant kissed my wrist softly before he let his fangs sink in.  There was a big difference between Ant and Armand's bite.  Where Armand had been friendly and pleasant, Ant's was down right erotic.  He had no control over the bite.  I felt my knees give way but Ant leaned into me pinning me against the counter as he fed from my wrist.  He took more than Armand, I felt faint but the feeling only made the euphoric state better.

"Damn." I whispered.

Ant laughed as he released my wrist, but he still held me in place.  "You good?"

I gripped the edge of the counter and nodded and felt his body move away from me, I was decidedly colder now.  There was a knock at the door and Ant moved to open it.  Walker in his faded blue jeans and his tight gray t-shirt stood on the other side.  He smiled, "Am I interrupting something?"

Ant shook his head, "We just finished."  The look he gave Walker made the other man pale.  Ant grinned purposefully showing his fangs.  A gesture he never did.

Walker's expression went blank and he stepped inside before closing the door behind him.  "You know he fed a vamp earlier today, isn't that dangerous?"

Ant shrugged.  "I offered to let him wait, he said he was good."

Walker gestured to me standing by the counter, still leaning more so than standing.  "Does that look good to you?"

Ant frowned, "He's better than he was when I got here."

Walker rolled his eyes and turned to me, "Did lover boy dump you or something?"

I shook my head.  I definitely didn't want to talk about Treec with Walker.  "Sage is working to my knowledge."

Ant smirked, "So there is a lover boy?  You are dating?"

I grinned at Ant with a playful smirk, "Jealous?"

Ant rolled his eyes.  "Of you.  Never.  Seriously, Nox.  You have a boyfriend?"

I nodded.  "I think so."

Walker laughed.  "He does.  He's ditched me twice to see him."

I picked up my wallet, my keys and my phone and opened my front door.  "Let's go talk to this Truth, see if we can find this last conspirator."
