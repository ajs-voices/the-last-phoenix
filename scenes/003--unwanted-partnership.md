# Unwanted Partnership

My phone vibrated on the bar where I left it. Mia stood up and grabbed it as she was closest. She frowned at it and handed me the offending device, “It’s Dae’lin. Can’t she wait till after breakfast?”

Mia sighed. “I suppose it is. Don’t take it at the table, please. I broke Jason of the bad habit.”

Nodding I stood up and went into the living room and sat on the couch as I answered the call on the last ring. “Hey.”

“Is that how you answer the phone?” Dae’lin scolded me.

“Yeah. I knew it was you. And Mia isn’t happy you are interrupting breakfast.”

The line went silent for a moment while she was busy doing something. The only sound was tapping of the keyboard. “I’m sorry.” I could hear the frown on her face as she continued, “I forgot that you were out in Brooklyn this morning.”

I smiled. “You’d think you’d learn to check my schedule, we’ve only been doing this dance since I was six.”

“I know. I know. Too busy. I need you in the office today. When are you planning on coming back?”

“After breakfast. Jace and Mia have to work.”

“Can you be in my office by 10?” She sounded distracted by the person who had entered her office. Super human hearing had its advantages.

“Yeah, Dae’lin. I can be there by 10. It’s only 6ish now.” I stood up. “I need to get back to my breakfast before it gets too cold.”

“10. Nox. It’s on your schedule.” Dae’lin said before she hung up the phone.

I tucked my phone back into my hoodie pocket and sat back down at the table with Jace’s family. Mia smiled at me, “Work call?”

“No. She was calling to chit-chat. Apparently there is this new eyeliner she wants to know about.” I said, my voice dripping with sarcasm.

Mia rolled her eyes. “What time did she want you in?”

“Ten. That will work right?” I asked. I knew Jace had class earlier than that on most days.

Jace nodded. “Yeah. Though I don’t know why Dae’lin would call you for make-up advice.”

“Why not?” Both Mia and I asked at the same time.

“Because she does a better job of it than you do. You can’t draw a straight line to save your ass. It’s all crooked.”

Jace reached across the corner of the table where he sat next to me and attempted to smear the crisp lines of my left eye. I dodged out of the way biting at the offending hand. Jace jerked it back to escape my teeth and Naya giggled at the reaction.

Mia rolled her eyes as Jace tried again and I attempted to bite him again with a smile on my lips. Naya was in hysterics. Mia stood up and picked up her baby then frowned at us. “I don’t know who is more childish you two or the baby. I’m thinking it’s the two of you.” She pointed at us with two fingers and gave us that look every parent has perfected that said you are so in trouble.

Jace and I laughed and stood up to clear the table. Jace took my plate from my hands and shooed me away. “I got this. You cooked. I can clean up.” Jace leaned over and whispered, “If I don’t Mia will make me sleep on the couch.”

I laughed as Mia yelled across the room. “I still heard that.”

Mia got the baby ready while I put my things away and made sure I had everything I needed to take with me. They let me keep things here, which was great for impromptu stays. My life could fit into three duffel bags and a backpack, but I owned furniture now.  Though I still  liked to believe I could pick up and go anytime. I wouldn’t want to.

We were all in the car by 7am. I got to sit next to Naya in the back seat and we had the cutest dialog half way to the City before she drifted off to sleep. Jace drove into work everyday. I don’t think I could manage that. I didn’t like driving in cities, and I didn’t like driving in New York City of all places.

I preferred being able to do productive things on my commute. Having to pay that much attention for the drive that far would set me on edge and I didn’t need more anxiety attacks. I was lucky that having an adult life with no schedule 80% of the time was working it as well as it was. Holiday’s in the Academy killed me. I wasn’t good with drastic changes.

We drove into the city and I couldn’t help remembering the first time I’d done so. I was so young then, so afraid of everything. Everything was so flat here. I wasn’t used to it, the air was wet and polluted, I hid my nose against my shirt sleeve to keep from having to breathe in all the new smells. It wasn’t home.

Dorian sat beside me. He’d come for me at the airport where my mother left me. She hadn’t even said goodbye. She had called me a monster and spit on me only a day before she dragged me on a plane kicking and screaming. The situation terrified me and when we took off my fear jumped into my throat and I cam close to vomiting. My mother did nothing to comfort me. I was a monster. I was no longer her son. She told me that over and over again as we flew from Boulder to JFK.

Once we landed we waited in the terminal for someone to show up. Dorian was an hour late. My mother gave him the wrong time. He was nice, and he smelled like vanilla and cinnamon. After my mother scolded him about being late, he took me to a little red car big enough to fit two people in. It looked like a clown car. My bag fit in the back but it was close. Dorian didn’t seem to mind as we drove through the City.

The buildings were so tall. I still awed at them even now that I’ve lived here the rest of my life. We are so small, so inconsequential, yet my life is meant to protect everyone around me. I was gifted with the ability to bend the elements. I didn’t think it was a gift in the beginning, but I wouldn’t change it for the world. The love of my mother was a big loss for me. There were many losses for me throughout my short life span. But I am grateful for my life - for my experiences. They made me who I am today and I’m proud of me, even if no one else is.

I knew we were getting close to the Apex Unlimited building - the home of the Venatori. Not all Venatori lived in the building, but seventy percent did. That was an actual number. There were hunters out in the world, and there were other communities - much smaller around the world in small regional headquarters. Or places like Jace’s family - those people who kept us fed and made money for us.

The entirety of our race could live in the AU building. Some years it was a ghost town, unlike now where there is more Venatori in one place than there had been in centuries. A convergence of power some said, others said it was safety in numbers. But it was a sign that things were changing that was something everyone agreed upon.
Jace parked his big black SUV in the parking garage. And he and his family headed for the elevator. I walked with them until the doors opened and my fear of heights overwhelmed my senses. The elevator looked innocuous now, but I knew once it was at ground level again, it would open into the lobby and you could see everything around you through the plate glass walls. My heart was in my throat. My pulse raced through my body. I shook my head and forced a smile on my face I knew didn’t reach my eyes. “I’m gonna take the stairs.”

Jace nodded and wrapped an arm around my shoulders in farewell before he joined his wife and daughter. I waved at Naya as the doors closed and I made my way to the stairs.

I took the stairs two at a time for 28 flights. It was nothing. I’d done the entire ground to roof before. Some days I did it instead of going for a run.

It was still early for my appointment with Dae’lin, but I went that direction anyway. The Venatori headquarters was a place that was always busy. It was also the only place in the building where you’d find many supernatural creatures. At night we even had a few vampires who worked with us. It’s not how you’d think it would look with a bunch of magical beings walking around. This isn’t tv it’s real life. Everyone is mostly human looking. The vampires have fangs, but most are retractable and short of their pale complexions you’d never know what they were. Same goes for the were-wolves, were-bears, and well anything were, or more appropriately called Therians. They are humans infected with the Lycanthropy virus of specific creatures all of which are predators. They change once a month at the full moon, and only the strongest of them can change at will.

We even have a dragon working as a receptionist. Her name is Mabel, and she collects pens. A cup of pens lined her desk. You may not use the pens in the cups on her desk. If you want to get on Mabel’s good side you buy her a unique pen - chances are she already has it, but she’ll like you more for trying.

All dragons collect things - it’s in their nature. But short of the collections, you’d never know they were anything but human. I couldn’t name any supernatural creature we monitored and policed that couldn’t at least pull off being human. But there were monster monsters we hunted when they became an issue for society, but most of our job was to make sure the species that made up the Clandestine Providence didn’t prey on the weak and soft humans who knew nothing of the world we lived in, yet were the reason the Clandestine Providence existed.

Lost in my head I ran into someone striding down the halls in front of me. It wasn’t a bad collision, but my chest ached where the big hulk of a shoulder rammed into my solar plexus. Rude much? But when I looked up to see who I’d run into to apologize I saw a pair of identical chocolate eyes staring back at me.

I dropped my gaze to the floor. “I’ll watch where I’m going next time.” I moved to step around my father and go about my business.

He caught my arm and turned me to face him. “Boy, what’s your problem? You are always in your head. I can’t believe they let you hunt if you are so easily distracted.”

I sighed and glared at my father. He was always finding something wrong with me and the way I did things. He thought he was making up for all the time he’d not known about my existence, but I was a grown man by the time he found out I was his son. The irony of it is I had looked up to Kai Viddens my entire life. He was one of the best hunters out there. His record was untarnished. He was a man who the women adored, and he was the hunter every kid wanted to be, especially me.

But by the time I’d found out he was my father my self imposed bitterness against my biological father was so ingrained and entwined with my mommy issues that my daddy issues were too strong. I despised the man who gave me life as I despised the woman who did. It was difficult for me to differentiate between the two ideologies in my mind. I was working on it with my therapist, but I wasn’t there yet and neither was my father.

Kai shook me again, “See there you go again.”

But I didn’t have to say anything. I smelled the soft scent of my savior coming my way. His voice was deep, and he had nothing but a smile for me when I looked at him as he came around the corner. Dorian Vega. The one man who I respected more than anyone else. He was the father figure I had as a child. He was my friend now. Dorian smiled at Kai and touched the hands there gripping my shoulders and Kai removed his tight grip on me. “Nox is safe here, he lets his mind wander. He is not so careless outside of the safe zone of the Apex Unlimited Building.”

Kai glared at Dorian. “Mind your own business, Dorian. My son and I were having a discussion.”

Dorian laughed. “Your son is my business. Or had you forgotten?”

The fury on my father’s face grew, he turned red and the vein in his forehead pulsed. “I did not know he existed, or I would have done something about this attitude of his. You raised my boy to be a fucking fag.”

I stepped between my father and Dorian and put my hand on my father’s chest and shoved him backwards. “Dorian did not make me a fag. I did not turn Nick into a fag. We were born the way we were born and there is nothing you can do about it.” My sexuality was another of my father’s hang ups. I liked men get over it. I also liked women, but that fact seemed to escape him. What made it worse was that I had kissed my brother.

Neither Nick nor I had known we were brothers. How could we when I didn’t know who my father was until I was 18. We were in the same classes for most of our lives. He liked boys, I liked boys. We kinda hooked up for a little while. We got caught kissing in the hallway on our way to do more intimate things and I was told to stay away from Nick by Kai Viddens, Dae’lin and Dorian. So I did. But only because Dorian had asked, not told me to.

Dorian put his hand on my shoulder and guided me around Kai. “Nox, go meet with Dae’lin. She’s ready if you are. Even though it’s early you don’t look too busy.”

I nodded, and I left Kai staring daggers at my mentor and friend and hoped that I hadn’t made things worse for Dorian. It was bad enough that Kai and Dorian’s father were partners. Kai was a friend of the family. I was a friend of the family but that only made the strain worse. I caused problems everywhere I went.

Dae’lin’s office wasn’t too far from the encounter with my father. I knocked on the closed door and the voice that made me jump all my life called out, “Enter.” And I had no choice but to obey. She still made me jump at her commands though now I could ignore then if I wanted to. But I tried not to do that lest she tell me to go to hell and I’d have to work for someone I didn’t like. The office was small, and it was already full. Another man, I knew his face but not his name, sat in the corner chair leaving the one by the door for me while Dae’lin sat behind her desk tapping away at the computer in front of her.

Dae’lin raised her head and tucked a strand of straight raven black hair behind her hear. Her eyes widened in surprise. “Nox you are early?” She looked at the time on her watch as she added, “You are never early.”

“I was in the neighborhood.” I smiled. “I can come back.”

Dae’lin shook her head, “No, no. Sit down.” She pointed her whole hand at the man in the corner with her palm facing up. “This is Walker Moore. Walker this is Nox Sétanta. I would like him to help you on your current task, Walker. Nox is very knowledgeable about the City’s undercurrents and the dragons of the city in particular.”

He sighed. “He is also the hunter with the lowest count.”

I laughed as I sat down in the other chair. “My record is higher than my father’s. Just because I don’t kill them, doesn’t mean it doesn’t count.”

Walker frowned. “You cheat. We shouldn’t work with the creatures we hunt.”

I hated this bigotry. It was everywhere for everything. Your sexuality, your gender, your race, your species. You’d think a secret society hidden inside the human world would be bigger than the humans they protected, but no we were worse than any human could ever be. I sighed. “Dae’lin I can’t work with him.” I stood up to leave.

But Dae’lin called me out. “Nox. Stop.” I had no choice but to comply. “Walker needs your help. I wouldn’t assign you this unless I didn’t think you’d be an asset to the problem at hand. Walker is hunting a bank robber. We have her on camera using her fire breath to scare the patrons. This wasn’t her first bank robbery, and it won’t be her last. Just the first where we had to cover up what the patrons saw. So we need to find her before things get out of hand.”

“So why do you need me? Sounds like a pretty cut and dry case. Dragon’s are never far from their hoards. She’ll always go home.” I said.

Dae’lin frowned. “Walker is just off his first hunt, I thought it was an easy case since we had an image to go from, not just rumors. But he’s hunted outside the City for his first hunt, tracking outside is easy, inside the cement and concrete of New York City, it’s not as easy as it seems.”

Walker interjected, “It’s not just that Dae’lin. She’s not following any patterns. I don’t know the city well enough yet.”

“Nox, he needs your help. Walker will chill with his sentiments while he works with you. Won’t you Walker?”

“Yes, ma’am.” He said as he stared back at me.

Dae’lin continued oblivious to the look I was getting. If looks could kill I’d be fighting for my life but she whispered. “And Walker, Nox is lead now. You need his contacts. They won’t talk to you.”

“Why would anyone talk to him?” He quipped.

I smiled. “Because I’m not a bigoted ass and I can charm just about anyone.” I gave him an evil grin, “Except maybe you.”

“What’s that supposed to mean?” Walker asked as he stood up.

Dae’lin was rolling her eyes as we left the office. She mumbled to herself, “I hope they don’t kill each other.”

I gave Dae’lin a flourishing bow in response to her spoken comments. She turned a bright shade of pink and I grinned back at her. I did very much love proving that I was not human weak.
