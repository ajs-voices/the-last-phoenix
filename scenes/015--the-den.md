# The Den

We followed Ant outside and into the back of the building.  My stomach churned at the knowledge of how Ant intended us to get to where we were going.  He offered me his hand which I took without question.  He grabbed Walker by the elbow and he literally stepped into the shadows of the buildings and we stepped out some place else.

I bent over clutching at my stomach thankful I had eaten nothing, but the wine returned from whence it came and wasn't as good coming back up as it had when it had gone down.  I wiped my mouth, and I saw Walker was a pale shade of green retching his own stomach contents onto the alleyway pavement.

"I hate when you do that."  I said to Ant.

"Sorry.  It's faster."

I sighed, "We could have taken the train."

Ant nodded, "We could have and we could miss Truth."  We followed Ant to a black door several feet from where we entered the alleyway shadows.  Ant pushed the door in and it gave way to a long hallway with filtered music coming from the other end of it.  The doors on the side as we moved down the hallway were all locked.  I hadn't tried them all but I knew they would be.  

The room beyond the hall was filled with computer screens and black light posters everywhere.  The music was a softer version of what would be in a club, same music just not as loud.  I could hear myself think.  There was a counter with coffee and pastries and it looked like a help yourself type place, but there was a girl sitting on the other side.  Ant approached her with a bright smile made purple with the black light.

"We are looking for Truth.  You know where we can find him?"  

The girl nodded.  "I'll get him."  But she didn't move, she tapped away at her laptop and then looked up.  "He'll be along when he's free a moment.  You aren't cops are you?"

Ant shook his head.  "No, Chevalier said I could borrow his help while he's out of town."

Her eyes went wide, "You know Chevalier, like personally?"

Ant nodded.  "He's family."

"Why are you looking for Truth if Chevalier is family?"  She asked.

"He's not here and I need help now.  He's off the grid."  Ant added to clarify why we couldn't use Jack.  I thought it was funny Jack used the term for human servant for a vampire as his code name.  Ironic really.

Walker walked around the room we were in taking in the posters and glancing at screens.  No one was hiding anything as he passed.  I wondered how much he understood about what was on their screens.  It looked like gibberish to me.

I leaned against the counter of goodies and watched the room.  Ant drifted into the crowded room to the stuffed couch in the back corner.  The girl behind the counter was tapping away at the keyboard when I caught someone to my left.  "Someone wanted me?"  

My head snapped to the left, and I saw a beautiful face staring back at me.  I grinned at him.  The girl nodded in my direction.  "Him and his friends."  She tapped me on the shoulder, "This is Truth."

I offered him my hand, and he blinked at me.  "What are you doing here?" he asked.

I smiled.  "Looking for you apparently."

Sage took my hand and smiled.  "Where did you hear the name Truth from?"

I pointed to Ant sitting on the couch.  "He knows Chevalier.  I know him too, but Ant says Chevalier told him how to get you to cooperate - either through common ground or through blackmail.  I told him I didn't think blackmail would be necessary, and that was before I found out you were The Wicked Truth."

"Where did you hear that name from?"  Sage asked.

"Same place.  Chevalier is a friend.  He's in Italy with Il Cane - no internet so he can't help me.  And I need some help with my case."

Sage grinned at me, "So this is what you will be doing late into the night? Bugging hackers?"

I laughed.  "Yeah.  I have a VOIP call that's being bounced around.  I need an origin location.  Presumably it's here in New York, but if they are a hacker, I suppose they can be anywhere to do whatever it The Dragon wants."

Sage asked nodding towards Ant, "Is he your partner?"

I shook my head.  "That is Anthony Giovanni, Il Cane's son." I looked around and found Walker staring at the computer screen of some girl who was laughing.  Walker didn't seem to understand as he watched, but she kept laughing to herself.  I pointed to the blond who was my partner.  "That's Walker.  He's my partner."

I turned to face Sage completely and smiled at him.  "You think you could help me?  Or do I need Ant's information?"

Sage grinned.  "Why should I help you?"

I smiled back at him.  "I'll cook you dinner?  Whatever you want.  No expense too big."

"If I want lobster?"  Sage asked with a soft smile on his face.

"I might need to borrow your kitchen for that.  Mine doesn't have a stove top that will handle it well."

Sage laughed, "How do you know mine does?"

"I assume you have a full size kitchen not a studio apartment."  I smiled at him.  "Am I wrong?"

Sage shook his head.  "You aren't wrong.  When can I expect payment?"

"Whenever you want."

Sage offered me his hand.  "I help you, and you cook me lobster.  We have a deal."

I gave him my hand, and we shook with wide smiles.  Sage at the end drew my fingers to his lips and kissed the back of my hand.  A shiver ran up my spine and I felt my smile grow wider.  "We have a deal."

Sage smiled.  "Let me get my things.  I need to get back home.  When do you want me to start?"

"Tomorrow is fine.  It's late now.  I'm sure Walker would be happy to take an early night."

Sage grinned.  "I'll meet you outside?"

I nodded.  "All right."

I watched Sage as he left to go back where he'd come from. I nodded to Ant, and he grabbed Walker and headed for the door.  Ant was laughing at me.  "Did you charm him into helping you?"

I shook my head.  "Not really."

Walker laughed.  "That's what it looked like."

I was grinning madly waiting for Sage to join us.  When he stepped out, I offered him my hand, and he took it with a smile on his face.  "Sage.  I'd like you to officially meet Ant and Walker.  Guys this is Sage or as you can guess he goes by Truth on the web."

Ant laughed.  "Fucking small world.  Wait if you knew a hacker already why the fuck did you come to Jack?"

I rolled my eyes.  "I've known Sage for all of four days.  I wasn't going to ask him for help like this after four days.  I wouldn't have now if it weren't for the fact that Jack trusts him.  If Jack trusts him to do jobs for Cari then I'll take him over anyone else in that joint."

Sage wrapped his arm around my waist and tugged me close.  "I would have helped either way, Nox.  Just ask me next time.  There is no need for blackmail."

"Hey, I never blackmailed you.  I bribed you.  Get that straight."  I grinned at him.

Ant asked, "What did he bribe you with?"

Sage grinned.  "He's cooking me dinner."

Ant laughed, "You know you could have done so much better than that right?"

Sage laughed.  "Let me correct myself, he's making lobster."

Ant whistled.

Walker sighed.  "I'm so jealous."  He punched me in the arm, "Do you even know how to cook lobster?"

I shook my head.  "Nope, but I intend to learn."

Sage tugged me in one direction.  "Walk me home.  I assume I'll see you two tomorrow morning, too?"

Walker looked at me.  "He'll look into the number we can't track tomorrow morning.  Say 8?"  I looked at Sage.

"Sounds good."  Sage smiled at Ant.  "Tell Chevalier that his friends are my friends if they are as cute as Nox."

Ant laughed, "Jack will agree with you on that."

I rolled my eyes.  "Jack doesn't think I'm cute.  He thinks I'm mean."

"He does think you are mean.  Meaner than Ryan, Tony or I, but he still thinks you are cute for a guy."  Ant smiled.

"He's never told me that."  

Sage tugged on me again.  "Walk me home."

I smiled at him and kissed his check, "Right.  I gotta go.  I'll see ya in the morning.  7 am I'll make you breakfast."

Ant frowned, "I don't ... fine.  I'll be there."

Walker waved.  "Have fun you two."

I smiled at him.  "Always."  Walker headed the opposite direction of us and Ant followed catching up to him and leaning in closer and Walker shook his head.  I can only imagine Ant was offering him a ride home.  Sage tugged on me again, this time I dutifully followed.  "I'm coming."

Sage grinned at me before leaning in to whisper, "Not yet you aren't."

A small moan escaped my lips before I could stop it and Sage was chuckling to himself.  "I love that."

I smiled.  "Me to,."  

We walked for several blocks before Sage turned down a side street and then down an alley way.  I asked, "Alley's are a little dicey at this time of night, aren't they?"

He smiled.  "I've pack protection.  Besides you are with me now."

"So you don't take this alley way without me?"  I asked playfully.  I knew the answer before he even said it.

"I do.  But no one will hurt me.  This is all Adrian's territory.  Even the gangs won't mess with Adrian."

"Still risky."  I said.

"Are you going to tell me not to walk down here at night?"  Sage asked.  I wasn't sure what he wanted as an answer.  It seemed a serious question, but the smile quirked on his lips made it seem a joke.

I shook my head.  "I would never presume to tell you how to live your life.  Unless you wanted me to.  You have protected yourself without me for your entire life.  Who'm I to say what's safe and what's not?"

Sage smiled.  "Most guys would have been all, 'no, you can't walk this street alone'."

"I'm not most guys."  I smiled at him.

Sage laughed, "No, you are not."  He smiled at me, "Would you prefer if I stuck to well lit pathways?"

I nodded.  "I would.  But I would stick to well lit pathways in any territory if it were me.  I'm paranoid that way."

"So you are more afraid this way than if we'd taken the long way?"  Sage asked.

"Not afraid, but there are shadows that big bads could jump out from and we'd never see them coming.  I hunt monsters for a living.  The dark is never safe for me.  Some vamps can walk from shadow to shadow with ease.  Ant is one of them.  His mother and father are two of the most powerful Shadow vamps in the world."

Sage nodded.  "I will stay on the streets then.  For you."

I smiled.  "You don't have to do it for me.  Just don't tell me you walked down an unlit alley way."  

Sage grinned.  "I'll stay to lit paths.  I don't want to cause you undue stress."

"Thank you."  I beamed at him.

"Anytime."  We turned back on to the street proper and Sage started up the stairs of one of the brownstone houses.  "This is me."  He pulled his keys out and turned to face me as he leaned against the door.  He pointed around the corner.  "Back there is my office.  You can all go there at 8 instead of trying to get me here."

I nodded with a smile.  "Okay."  

Sage and I stared at each other for several minutes without speaking.  Neither of us really wanted to part ways, but I didn't think going inside was going to be a good idea either.  Sage broke the silence first.  "Do you want to come in?"

"I do." I smiled, "But, I think it would be a bad idea."

Sage laughed.  "I promise I won't let you see my bedroom."

"Or the couch?"  I asked.

Sage nodded.  "Nothing we can use to have sex on.  Will that work for you?"

I let out a mock sigh of defeat and smiled.  "Fine, if I must."

Sage grinned and turned to unlock the door.  I followed him into the darkened entry way.  Sage walked a few feet and turned on the lamp on the table.  "Upstairs are the bedrooms.  Down here, the living room and the kitchen." Sage pointed to the living room as we walked past and let me through to the back of the hall into his kitchen.  He flipped on the light and I was greeted with a stone fireplace and a great gas stove on the other side of a large slab granite island. "Wow."  I said as I looked around at his kitchen.

Sage laughed.  "It's a shame I can't cook."

I smiled at him.  "Oh, but I can."  I ran my hands over the granite counter top.  All the appliances were stainless steel and a set of red pots hung from the ceiling, they looked like they'd never been used.

I could feel Sage watching me as I took it all in.  He asked.  "You like?"

"I love.  Why do you have such a great kitchen if you can't cook?"

"Rosie thought if I would ever attract a wife, I needed a good kitchen."

I laughed.  "A wife, huh?"

Sage laughed.  "I don't think she counted on me finding a gorgeous guy who was a great cook."  He smiled, "How did things go with that girl tonight?"

I frowned and turned my back to Sage as I pretended to still be in awe of his kitchen.  I don't think he fell for it as he put his hand on my shoulder and turned me to face him.  He asked, "What happened?"

I sighed.  "She just wanted sex.  Called me a whore when I said no and accused me not liking her because she was fat - her word not mine.  And told me I wasn't the fatherly type."  I shrugged.  "It's not a big deal."

Sage frowned and pulled me close.  "It is a big deal.  You are upset by it."  He pushed me into the bar stool next to the island.  "Sit.  Ice-cream helps heal all wounds. I might even have chocolate in here."

"No, Sage.  It's all right.  I don't need ice-cream."

Sage laughed.  "I do though."  

I watched Sage open his bottom drawer freezer and pull out a half gallon of chocolate ice-cream and grabbed two spoons from the drawer and set it down on the island and took a seat next to me.  "She's not seen you with Drake.  I have.  You are a good father."

I smiled and dipped my spoon into the ice-cream and offered it to Sage.  He grinned at me and took the proffered ice-cream.  "Don't let her get you down.  I'm sure there are girls out there that will be what you need."

I sighed.  "She is what I need.  She doesn't want to be a mother.  She only wants to have a baby - no relationship, just sex to make a baby.  But she didn't want to talk about it.  Like having sex right then was the only option - the only way I'd say okay - let's do this."

Sage nodded and took another spoonful of ice-cream.  He finished the cold mouthful before he said something.  "Clearly she has self image issues.  Large women usually do.  Was she unattractive?"  

I shook my head.  "No.  She had rolls and stretch marks, but nothing that would make me say 'Ew, get away from me.'"

"You saw her naked?"  Sage asked.

I laughed.  "She came to my apartment wearing nothing but an over-sized trench coat and when she propositioned me she did so with it hanging off her elbows gaping open to reveal her figure."

"Has anyone ever done that to you before?"  Sage asked.

I shook my head.  "I don't tell girls where I live."

"Surely Venatori girls know where you live?"  Sage asked.

I shrugged.  "They could find out I guess.  But Venatori girls don't proposition me regularly.  Remember they think I'm gay."  I waved my hand at him and ran my long fingers through the top of my hair highlighting the aspects obvious to people.

Sage reached into my back pocket and pulled out my phone and swiped and tapping away at it.  A few moments later he laid the phone down on the counter in front of us.  "This her?"

Sage had easily found Treec's contact information on my phone. I nodded, and when I did he tapped the call button.  "What are you doing?" I said reaching for the phone.

Sage had it in his hand and was pulling it away.  He tapped the speaker phone button and waited for the woman to answer.  "What the fuck do you want, Nox?"

"Nox is here, but that's not who is calling you."  Sage said politely into the air.

"Who are you?"  Treec asked.  I could hear the distinct sound of someone who had been crying. I sighed to myself and dropped my head on to my hands and took a deep breath.

"It doesn't matter who I am.  Only that I care about Nox.  He wanted to talk to you tonight about your duty to the community.  He still wants to talk to you.  And by talk I mean with words and stuff not some strange code for sex.  From what I understand, your goals and his align well, but if you'd talked about it you'd understand he doesn't want to ram it home until it takes."

I snorted at Sage's use of words.  Treec yelled, "He's right there isn't he?  Fucking bastard can't talk himself."

I sat up ready to yell but Sage put a finger to my lips and smiled.  "He is right here.  But he won't speak to you until you stop with the name calling, and you treat him with respect.  You want something.  He wants something, there is no reason why the two of you can't talk respectfully to one another and work out a solution."

"He can't fight his own fights?  He's even weaker than I thought."  Treec laughed.

I sighed.  "I reiterate my words.  Fuck you, Treec."  I used air to hit the end call button and Sage frowned at me.

Sage took a deep breath.  "I'm sorry."

I shrugged.  "None of that was your fault."

"I figured she'd listen."  Sage frowned.  "Apparently she's just a bitch in general."

I shrugged. "I'll find someone else.  Though I'm sure I'll have new rumors circulating come morning.  I came on to her, she refused me and I pushed harder.  Then I called up my boyfriend to fight my fights."

"I'm sorry Nox."  Sage stood up and wrapped his arms around me.

I smiled.  "You were only trying to help."  I turned in his arms and kissed his neck.  "I should get going Sage.  I have work to do in the morning and I need to pick up Drake at my Dad's and make them breakfast."

Sage laughed, "Do you feed everyone who does you favors?"

I nodded.  "It's my go to payment."

Sage smiled and kissed me softly.  "A kiss will do sometimes."

"Only for you, love."  I smiled up at him.

"That's twice."  Sage said as he backed up and put the ice-cream away and the spoons in the sink.

"What's twice?" I asked.

"You called me love."  Sage said from the sink as he looked at me gaging my reaction to his observation.

I took a deep breath. "Is that a problem?"

Sage shook his head.  "No.  But this isn't slowing down any is it?"

"I don't think I know how to slow down."  I grinned at him.  "I have always attached quickly to people I let in."

Sage smiled, he took my hand, and we walked back down the long hall to the front door.  "I will see you tomorrow.  Bring me coffee."

I nodded.  "Yes, sir."

Sage had his hand on the door knob but he pulled me close and wrapped his free hand around my waist and kissed me deeply.  Our tongues danced in each other's mouths and I could taste the chocolate ice-cream lingering on his tongue.  I almost wished it was still chilled from it.  The thought alone tensed my body and I let out a small sound that made Sage laugh through the kiss.  "God, I love the effect I have on you."

"Me too."  I smiled and kissed him softly on the lips.  "I'll see you bright and early."  Sage turned the knob and opened the door stepping away from me.  I waved quickly as I walked out.  I turned around when I was down the stairs, "Night, Sage."

"Night, Nox.  Text me when you get home so I know you made it safe."

I laughed.  "Okay."  I only hoped I didn't forget to when I made it home.
