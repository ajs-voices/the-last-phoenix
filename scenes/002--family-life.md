# Family Life

We took the subway to Brooklyn.  Jason had gone to school with me since we were five years old, but his family was old school Southern.  They owned a piece of land down home that provided fresh food to the Apex Unlimited compound and their other subsidiary businesses.  They weren't farmers who struggled - they were rich and well off and they had a large family and tons of employees.  

He went home every holiday we had off and he drug me with him occasionally.  The first time he'd asked me, we weren't even friends - his parents made him.  

Mrs. Hill was helping Jace pack the last of his things for winter break.  And she asked, "You going anywhere for the holiday's Nox?"

I shook my head no.  "No, ma'am."

Jason said in sing song, "He doesn't have a family," making fun of me.

Mrs. Hill gasped. "No family?  Really?"

I only shrugged.  I didn't care.  I was five, and I was still hoping my mother would decide I could come home, but she'd not responded to any of Dorian's queries and I stayed at the Academy while everyone else was home with their folks, even if their folks lived in the same building they would be upstairs with them.  But not me.  I had no family.  Mrs. Hill took pity on me.  "Pack your things then, Nox.  You are coming home with us."

Jason groaned.  But I knew better than to disobey.  Obedience had been beaten into me since my first days there. 

I went home with Jace and his family.  At first Jace and I hated each other, we only hung out because his mother would mention it otherwise.  I was more than happy to sit with my nose in a book or working on my control of the elements.  But she insisted I have fun with Jace.  And after awhile we became good friends.  It took time away from other boys to find out we had a lot in common, and that we liked each other. 

But Jace was a family guy.  He wanted the whole deal - wife, kids, house and a white picket fence.  And he had all of that in Brooklyn including the white picket fence and an in-ground swimming pool.  Naya, their 9-month-old daughter, would be the highlight of my stay with them.  I hadn't seen her since her birth.  Just so busy that I hadn't got time to spend time with her or them. 

So for my birthday they promised to take me out, if I promised to come home with them and cook breakfast on top of it.  The whole family package except it wasn't my family.  One day we'd be able to do both our families together, but that required me to settle down or at least find a girl willing to make babies with me.  I'd be happy even as a single parent, I don't know if I could handle the stress alone, but I have help. 

Once we were in Brooklyn, Jace drove his black SUV from the train station to their house.  They lived in a tight neighborhood with a bunch of two story brownstones.  A white picket fence surrounded his yard and was much larger than most houses in the neighborhood.  He'd been smart and bought two properties and ripped them both down to build what he wanted including the in ground pool in their back yard.  It looked out place in this Brooklyn neighborhood, but the Hill's were a popular family with all their weekend pool parties in the summer. 

Mia unlocked the door and a short brunette stepped out of the kitchen carrying a small fussing bundle with brown hair sticking up out of the blanket.  "Hey, sweet thang.  I missed you," I said as  I took the baby from their babysitter without asking. She squawked at me.  "Hey!  What the hell..."

Mia laughed.  "It's okay.  Lynn this is Nox, he's Naya's godfather."  Which was as close as the human terms came to what I was to Naya, we called it pareses.  If anything happened to Jace and Mia, I would become their children's guardian but it was much more than that and hard to explain.

The little teenager stared at me as I lifted Naya above my head and the baby giggled. "Hey, baby."  I danced around their living room with the sweet little baby.  I could feel the eyes of the teenager girl on me.  When I looked up, I grinned at her and Mia frowned while she whisked her off to the front door.  

Jace laughed.  "You'll flirt with anyone."

I grinned down at Naya cradled down in my arms, "I only got eyes for you, baby."

Mia came back in.  "That's not what you said earlier.  Your blue-eyed mystery boy?"  Mia giggled behind her hand. 

I sat down on their faux leather couch with Naya in my arms.  "Yes, Naya.  There was this beautiful man with bright sapphire blue eyes."  I kissed her cheek and nuzzled my nose against her and she cooed back at me.  "He gave me his number and I might actually call him."  I picked her up over my head and leaned back against the couch.  She giggled.  "What do you think of that?"

Mia sat down next to me. "I think, if you don't mind me saying. I think you should call him.  He was cute."

I nodded.  "He was."

Mia smiled at me cuddling with her daughter.  "You will be such a great dad.  Naya loves you so much."

"I love her so much." My voice dropped into that baby talk voice.  "I can't wait to have my own."

"I saw Dr. Silas bothering you.  She your progeny agent?"

"I nodded.  Yeah she apparently knows nothing about me.  Hasn't ready any of my files or spoken to anyone who knows me.  We could have talked months earlier if she'd just scheduled an appointment like everyone else."

"Nox, would you like me to schedule that appointment for you?"  Mia put her hand on my knee.  "I will let her know when I see her in the morning."

"Why the hell not."  I said with a sigh, I didn't want to talk about how ineligible I was or the fact I liked men or even I was half human, but it was all going to be a factor in everything this lady wanted.  My obligation to have children is only a chore because I'm on a timeline.  Being Venatori isn't always a good thing. 

Jace stood in front of me holding his arms out as if I would give him his child.  I looked up at him with a grim smile and he pouted.  "Aw, come on man.  She has to go to bed.  Don't steal my one thing from me."

"Your one thing?  You mean this is the only time you help Mia out?"

Jace stammered, "Well, uh. No, but dude this is my baby time.  Mine!"

I handed the small bundle of joy over to her father.  "Fine.  I guess I don't want to change diapers just yet."  I stuck my tongue out at him as he did the same.  Yes, we were childish, and we both loved it.  

Mia giggled as she got up.  "I'm going to grab a shower.  You go swim and join us in the big bed Nox.  We already discussed it.  You sleep better when someone's with you and you've not had anyone with you in a while.  Call it a birthday gift, if you want, but you are staying in our bed tonight."

"Yes ma'am."  I agreed reluctantly, which meant that Jace and Mia would sacrifice their comfort for mine tonight.  Not what I came out here for but I wouldn't argue with my hostess as she was getting ready for bed.

I stood up from the couch to do my thing.  I changed into swim trunks in the small golden half bath off the living room.  I stared at my self in the small mirror above the sink and sighed.  Why did I do this if I wanted to be a serious candidate for fatherhood?  Why did I still act the child?  Honestly, I did what I did because I'd always done it.  I didn't know how to be anything more than what I am.  And while I like to spend time alone in the comfort of my home or my family's home, because that is what Jace's family was. I still enjoyed being the guy everyone else knew me as.  They say fake it till you make it.  I think I made it.  I'm not sure that's a good thing or a bad thing, but I like who I am, and there is no doctor in the world who will change that. 

I pushed away from the sink after removing the eyeliner now instead of later and I headed for the kitchen.  The house was quiet and the moment I opened the sliding glass doors to the back yard in the kitchen I could hear the busyness of Brooklyn at night.  It was still scorching out, but I was going swimming so it didn't matter.  The ground was rough against the soles of my feet but the water was refreshing. 

I waded into the pool and then swam laps across the length of it.  It wasn't a huge pool, and it was only a few strokes long, but it was the perfect full body work out.  It was the best feeling in the world focusing on one thing - the only thing that mattered in that moment was making each movement count.  Pushing through the pain as I grew tired, I finished the allotted number of laps across the pool.  

By the time I finished an hour had passed and my arms and legs both felt like jelly.  I floated on my back staring up at the stars you could barely see with the city lights.  I knew there were more up there.  I'd see more in my life time.  It was one of few memories I had of my mother that were good.  

We sat outside our cabin high in the Rocky mountains laying on a large rock staring up at the stars.  I was almost five then, we'd sit looking for shapes in the stars like we did with the clouds in the daytime sky.  My mom tried to show me the big dipper, and other real constellations but I couldn't see what she saw.  So we made up our own.  It was a good memory, and I pushed it away as I climbed out of the pool.  My mother had hated me in the end, the memory was not worth remembering.

I grabbed my towel and dried off as I walked into the house.  Everything was dark, the light were all out, Mia and Jace had gone to bed while I swam.  I smiled as I pulled a dry pair of boxers and a t-shirt from my bag of clothes Jace always kept around.  I could have a permanent room here if I wanted one, but I didn't want to intrude.  And besides they needed both rooms if they would have two kids in the future. 

It wasn't the first time I'd slept on the couch, and it wouldn't be the last.  It was almost my second home, and it was better than sleeping on the ground.  There were pillows and blankets laying on the edge of the couch like Mia knew I wouldn't come to bed. I hope she understood. 

As I lay staring at the ceiling willing myself to sleep I knew the nightmares would come the moment I closed my eyes.  It was a chore just to sleep to put myself at the mercy of my mind.  But the body required sleep, so I forced my eyes closed and I began the soft rhythmic breathing I used for yoga.  As my breathing and heart rate slowed, I counted - focusing on nothing but breathing and the numbers.  It took effort to not let your mind wander in the depths of the darkness.  The darkness swept me away into the expanse of my own mind.

The darkness gave way to images - images that were always darker than the surrounding blackness. How it was possible I don’t know, but it was suffocating and the red glowing eyes came as they did every night for as long as I could remember. They came alone in the silence of the darkness wielding whips made of fire, jagged earth, razor-sharp air, the only element missing was water. Water didn’t make a good whip it was too soothing, too cooling. No, instead the ground find with it. My shoes and socks were soaking wet. The water wicked up my jeans making them damp and heavy across my hips.

Fog rolled in and the glowing red eyes made everything this hazy red color. The glow from the fire whips flickered against the fog and I bit back the fear that came when the fog did clouding my view of the darkness - of my nightmare.

I yelped the first time I’d felt the razor sharp sting of the whips applied to my skin. I no longer made a sound as the first blow landed across the center of my back. I bit back the pain and the scream. But making a sound only made it worse. I could feel the blood dripping down my back as the elemental tentacles of my nightmare rained down along my back. One word sounded over and over again as each blow landed, “Spark.”

The eyes grew closer. As they did every night. The closer they got the more fear rose, the harder each blow. The shorter the time between blows until the eyes were in front of me and I could almost make out the face inside the hood with the glowing red eyes, but as with every night it yelled, “Spark.”

My eyes flew open. My heart was racing, and I tumbled to the floor unable to move in the limited space of the couch cushions. The thump was loud, and I hoped I woke no one up as I lay on my back staring up at the ceiling. I didn’t bother checking the time, it was around 4am. It was always around 4am. My phone sitting on the coffee table started its chirping - 4am alarm. I hadn’t needed it in ages. My self-conscious woke up at 4am. My day would start regardless at 4am.

I crawled to the center of Jace’s living room and crossed my legs and sat down to begin my morning yoga practice. My arms and legs were still sore from swimming last night. It was a good feeling to have as I stretched into the first pose.

I hadn’t been holding it more than 15 seconds when I heard a soft chuckle coming from behind me. I can’t imagine it was anyone other than Mia - Jace didn’t giggle.

I turned around into the next pose and smiled up at Mia. She was wearing a flowery bathrobe and fuzzy slippers. “Hmmm?” I said as I stretched into the next pose.

Mia sat down on the couch, “I was just admiring the view.”

I grinned at her as I continued my workout. We sat in silence for the rest of the poses. 30 minutes with Jace’s wife watching me. If it had been any other girl I’d have sat down next to her and tried to make out. But she was my best friend’s wife, and I didn’t do married.

“I don’t know what everyone’s problem with you is. The girls at work all grin and giggle like school girls when they see you walk past. They don’t know you, but when I suggest they ask you out they shake their heads. They say, ‘No, No, he’s such a player’.” Mia sighed. “All these women will miss out on you if you are seriously thinking about calling this guy back.” Mia held up the card my mysterious blue-eyed man had given me. “I know men have always been your thing. But you can’t start a family with another man.”

I sat down next to Mia and plucked the card from her fingers and smiled at her. “Why can’t I? My father isn’t married. He’s got 5 kids plus me. I don’t need to be married to some women to have a family. I need a woman willing to fulfill her own duty with a half human Cesari who just prefers men over women. At least I don’t have it as bad as Dorian or Nick. They don’t even like girls.”

“I don’t want the ‘normal’ happy life. I want to be happy.” I air quoted normal. I would never be normal. I was weaker and slower than a true Venatori. But my senses were better than any human, I could heal quickly and there was the simple fact that I could bend the elements to my will. And even that talent was rare because I could bend all four elements at the same time. I wasn’t limited to just one element. That is what it meant to be Cesari. No, I’d never be normal.

I sighed setting the card on top of my phone and got up from the couch. “I’m gonna take a shower, then I’ll cook breakfast.”

Mia smiled, “Use our bathroom so you don’t wake Naya.”
“Jace awake?”

Mia shook her head, “No. But he’ll sleep through you walking through the bedroom.”

“Alright.”

I grabbed my bag of things from the golden half bath and headed into the master bedroom. Jace was groggy, but awake. He mumbled, “Come back to bed, babe.”

I chuckled, “I’d love to, babe, but I need a shower.”

Jace picked his head up and frowned. He blinked away the sleep and rubbed his eyes before he could focus on me. I smiled at him. “Mia told me to use your shower.”

He nodded and curled down inside his blankets again with a soft spoken, “Still welcome to join me.”

“I know, man. But I need a shower.”

Jace laughed under the covers, “Suit yourself at the ass crack of dawn.”

Their bathroom was decorated much the same as the one in the hall with soft golden tones everywhere. It must be Mia’s go to color for bathrooms. Either that or someone bought a lot of gold fixtures and needed to use them and they coordinated to it.

The shower was perfect. I always loved showering here, so much better than my own. The jets from every direction were a great feature, but it was the rain head that was the best. It was gentle and covered a large area. Perfect for the heat of the water. And the pressure was perfect without the jets.

It didn’t take me long to shower, but the moment I turned off the water and was wrapping a towel around my waist Mia opened the door and smiled at me. “Jace says he invited you to bed.”

“He thought I was you.” I chuckled as I stood in front of her sink applying my eyeliner.

“You are as bad as any girl. Must wear my make-up, even on the weekend when I can slack off.”

“At least I’m not doing my nails or coloring my hair in your sink.”

Mia laughed. “There is that.”

I dropped the towel to pull my clean boxers on and Mia laughed, “No boundaries either. I have bacon and eggs, can you make me pancakes too?” She giggled. “I had a reason to come in here, other than to ogle my husband’s best friend.”

Jace yelled from the opened bathroom door. “Hey, I want to ogle him too.” The sheets rustled and in a few moments Jace was standing in the doorway gawking at me. “Aw, it ain’t nothing I ain’t seen before.”

Jace paused as he moved around Mia to come into the bathroom and grabbed me by my shoulders and turned me with force so he could look at my back. “This looks red and angry.” His voice had grown heated and sharp. “Nox, what the fuck? Did you have a nightmare here?”

“Jason, I have nightmares every night.”

“They don’t always result in fresh marks, Nox. I thought it was better here?”

“It’s fine.” I stepped away from him and fell against the glass shower wall. “Nothing we can do about it.”

“Someone could do something. I do not believe you hurt yourself over and over again without someone manipulating you, Nox.”

I rolled my eyes. It was the same thing over and over again. Everyone always said the same thing, but there was no proof a dream walker was penetrating my dreams. I sighed before I interrupted his usual rant. “Who the hell wants to fuck with me since I was 6 years old? And why? I’m nothing!”

Jace turned beet read and Mia pushed him out of the bathroom ahead of her. “We don’t understand. That’s all. Why isn’t Dr. Silverman doing anything to help you?”

“She is. We go through it every week. Deal with it every week. I've had walkers sit with me at night and they confirm, I do this to myself. Nothing breaks the nightmares, Mia. Nothing.” I said the last with such defeat it scared me. I was never one to give up on things. It wasn’t something I did. To hear it in my voice was saddening. I knew I needed to find that which made me happiest and right now having a family was top on that list of things to try. It was one reason I had agreed to come home with Jace and Mia to be part of a family even if it wasn’t my own.

Mia nodded as she left. “We want to help you Nox, that’s all.”

I said, “I know,” as she shut the door behind her. I was left alone for the rest of the time I needed to get dressed. I picked up a simple t-shirt that looked like it had been splashed with different shades of oranges, yellows and reds. I pulled my grey hoodie over my arms and settled it on my shoulders before walking out of their bathroom into their bedroom which was empty. I was thankful for that small win.

Jace was in Naya’s room getting her ready in his boxers and Mia was in the kitchen. The strong smell of fresh brewed coffee was in the air and I walked into the kitchen to find a hot cup sitting on the bar separating the living room and the kitchen. “Pancakes?” Mia asked.
I nodded. “Anything for my favorite girl.”

Mia smiled. “I wish you’d find another favorite girl.”

I laughed. “We’ll see.”

Mia picked up my phone on the coffee table and the card that laid on it and set it on the bar. “Or you could call him.”

“We’ll see about that too.” I picked up the card and brought it to my nose and smelled it. It smelled like him, a slight hint of lavender. Mia laughed as I slipped it into my pocket. “Can I listen to music here or do I need my earbuds?”

“You are good. Naya is up.” Mia grinned. “I’m going to grab a shower. Jace is going to join me. You can manage Naya here?”

I nodded. “Of course. Enjoy the shower.”

Jace walked in and set Naya in her high chair with handful of Cheerios on it and followed Mia to their room.
I picked a playlist that would be least offending to tiny ears. It was all instrumentals of popular songs remade - artists like Apocalyptica, 2Cellos, Lindsey Sterling, and The Piano Guys. “This will work Naya.”

I made breakfast while Jace and Mia took their shower and other things. I made bacon in the oven on a rack so it was less of a grease fest and pancakes on Mia’s electric griddle. I disliked pancakes myself, but they were always fun to make. I was learning how to make pictures with the batter, but I still sucked at it, so I didn’t try this time. The scrambled eggs  finished cooking by the time Mia and Jason walked into the kitchen.

Everyone sat down at the kitchen table and it was the perfect family meal full of chatting and camaraderie. I was so ready for this.
