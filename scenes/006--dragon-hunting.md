# Dragon Hunting

I had been right, the rest of my afternoon was boring.  I sent Sage a text with an image of my dinner - steak and roasted sweet potatoes in olive oil and a little cinnamon and sugar and a small side salad with raspberry vinaigrette.

I was still running on the flames of the text and the memory of his lips against mine when I got dressed to go out. I decided I would not make Walker throat?uncomfortable so I play it down.  The upside, I would not get the shit kicked out of me at a potential biker bar.

I still work a thick swath of black eyeliner and my hair and nails were still matching sapphire blue from the night before.  But I wore black jeans that weren't too tight because I might end up running later in the evening if things went wrong.  I pulled on a plain white t-shirt under a white button up, which I didn't button up.  I didn't spike my hair after my shower; I let the blue tips fall over the right side and cover more of my Venatori tattoo on my right temple.  

The crossed swords were a dead give away to who we were.. It was a good thing only supernatural creatures could see them.

I sent Sage another text with a selfie in the mirror.

I grinned as I walked out the door with my phone and my keys.  My id and some cash were in my front pocket.  I brought nothing else when I went out - except two foil packs, but Sage had my stash and I really wasn't going to hook up.  It was ensurea work thing.

I took the stairs down to the lobby where I told Walker I would meet him. I looked around but Walker was no where to be seen, despite the fact I was through,sure I was late. I didn't check the time while I waited near the statue I'd made when I was ten.  They called it Atlas.  I hadn't called it anything.  It was a statue of a man holding a glass orb with a tiny living garden inside it.

I had used all four elements at the same time to create that statue, the seeds for the grass growing inside the glass orb was the only thing I hadn't created.  Dae'lin had itsimpressed as had everyone else in the Academy.  

Dorian had retested me in all the elements and I passed with flying colors. They rated me as an AC5 at 10 years old, the youngest Magnus to receive such a rating.

Walker walked towards me looking up at the statue behind me.  "I still can't believe you did that when you were just a kid."

I laughed.  "I can't believe it's still here."

Walker walked towards the lobby exit.  "Why not?"

I shrugged.  "I figure someone would be tired of it.  It's been here for 13 years."

"Like shit changes around here." Walker said as we headed down the street towards the subway station. 

I knew Walker was hard core in the Venatori.  There was little in the way of change in our species.  We'd spent the last few centuries stagnant in our beliefs.  We had changed with the times in terms of technology, but that had a lot more to do with the ease of information in the human world.  And all us young folks taking to it as we integrated into human society.  

My father for instance, never used a computer, but he had a cell phone.  We'd shared a text or two over the past several years but not many.  Nick and I talked more than me and my father did.  But then Nick was three months my junior.  We'd been acquaintances when we were in school.  Now Nick was a Scrin.  He worked in the Academy teaching kids how to use computers.  He was a tech geek, he always had been.  

Walker and I got on the train and we rode two stops before getting off.  In reality we could have walked just as fast.  But it gave us a chance to just relax before having to pay complete attention to our surroundings.  Not that Walker or I relaxed, we'd both been hunting just long enough that everything made us paranoid.

The Ugly Dog Saloon was a hole in the wall bar in between several other bars.  There were no Harley's or other bikes sitting outside the bar, there wasn't any parking on the streets most of the time.  And tonight was a street cleaning night so the cars would get towed and fined, always a pain in the ass for car owners.  For which I was grateful I was not.  

I knew how to drive but I didn't need to drive anywhere in the City.  When I needed to go to Jace's I would just take the subway and catch a cab or walk depending on the weather.  Jace owned one vehicle, but he drove back and forth everyday.

The door jingled when I opened it and let Walker in first.  He chuckled as he walked inside and found a table in the corner that was empty.  We had the eyes of everyone when we walked in, but no one said anything or moved, they sat in place and watched as we moved to a table in the corner.

I followed Walker and sat down opposite him, my back was to the room, which was all right for the moment.  Walker nodded towards the bar.  "You want a pitcher or bottles?"

"Bottle."  I said, and I turned my chair to sit more towards the wall as Walker got up to get us beers.

I scanned the room and let my vision see everything.  It was like turning on and off a light for me - turning off the patterns around us everyday.  The room swam in my vision as I took in everything at once.  I had to blink my eyes several times to clear the tears that had formed.

Walker sat down, "I wasn't gone that long, damn man.  Get a grip."  He grinned at me with a snide smile.

I grinned at him, "Everyone in here is supernatural and I mean everyone."

Every supernatural creature had a distinct pattern about them.  Dragons and therians - shape shifters who have the lycanthropy virus or more commonly called werecreatures - werewolves.  Even humans had a pattern around them, but it was dim.  The stronger it was the more sensitive to the Clandestine Providence they were - and they usually had human magic - they were called Paths.  I didn't know many paths, but I had met a few here in the City.

The wolves and the vampires ruled the City, but now there were dragons in their territory.  It hadn't started a turf war yet, but it was bittenlikely to happen soon if the dragons were this far in number in just the Ugly Dog Saloon.

I could see so many shadows of dragons in the patrons and the staff.  There were a few wolves who were drinking in a small group in the opposite corner as us.  There was a vampire in the corner farthest from the door.  But I wasn't sure if anyone else saw him in the shadows.  I saw him though.  It was hard to hide in the shadows when you could see the glowing patterns around a person.

I blinked my eyes and turned my extra senses off and then smiled at Walker.  "We have three wolves in the corner opposite us, and one vampire in the corner table farthest from the door.  Everyone else is a dragon."

The door jingled as another patron walked in.  I blinked as I saw a beautiful woman with ebony skin and golden hair with orange eyes walking towards the bar.  Her hair was not golden like human hair was golden, no this was like gold - as in the metal - strands hung from her head.  But I recognized her dragon form.  I nodded towards the woman and smiled at Walker.  "That's her."

"How can you tell?"

I smiled.  "She couldn't hide her dragon from me.  I wish I could see it for real.  The color of her hair and her eyes and the color of her skin I bet she's a gorgeous dragon."

Walker looked at me.  But he asked, "So Mr. Seasoned Hunter, what should we do?"

"Let's go talk to her." I said as I stood up.  Walker didn't follow me or at least I didn't feel him at my back.  But I didn't look back as I approached the bar and sat on the stool next to her.  There were a lot of eyes on me as I moved through the place.  Since everyone here was supernatural seeing my tattoo was a given, but I probably smelled very much like Venatori despite being only half.

The beautiful exotic woman looked at me with a straight face.  "There are plenty of other seats."

"I know." I replied.  

She looked to the bartender and then back to me and I turned to face her with what I hoped was a disarming smile.  Her eyes went wide as she saw the black ink below the orange tips that did not hide much of the tattoo at my right temple.  She gasped, "Venatori."

Her eyes blinked sideways like a reptile's would.  She was losing control of her humanness, but maybe with those eyes and that hair she didn't try to be more human.  "Ferrasss."  She lept backwards and darted through the door behind the bar.

The bartender stood in front of the opening staring at me.  "I only said I know."

"Why are you after her?"

I sighed.  "Derek right? Your father used to own this joint." I nodded knowing it was the truth.  "She used fire breath in front of humans."

He hung his head and stepped aside.  "Don't kill her.  We know who you are, please don't.  She has a son."

"You know who I am?  Or what I am?"

The man down the end of the bar spoke for the bartender, "You are the boy Venatori who would rather take us in.  But any you catch never actually come back out."  He stood up and walked towards me.  His right hand strayed over his waist which usually meant they had a gun.  I wondered where Walker was in that moment.  But I had my own problems to deal with and couldn't look for the man I had come here to help.

"I don't want to kill her.  Hell, I  don't care that she was robbing banks.  The humans can't contain her if they catch her."

"They won't catch her," the bartender said with a gruff grumble.

I frowned, "If I found her here, they will too.  Humans aren't idiots no matter what you might think.  They don't believe in things like magic."  The image of Sage falling out of his bar stool came to mind.  I had frightened him.  But it was what I am - who I am.  

"If I can bring her in, I can try to help her, and her son.  But if my friend finds her, she will be dead."  I knew this would go down bad if I didn't get out of here soon.

There were guns all around me.  And dragons that could breathe fire that was more terrifying that the guns.  I'd been burnt once with dragon fire - from a human form dragon none-the-less.  Who would have thought a dragon could still spew hot napalm like fire at you from a human throat?  I learned that the hard way, and I bore a mangled scar on my left leg from the encounter.  If I'd not been Cesari, I couldn't have put that fire out and I would have burned to death.  Dragon's fire was dangerous to confront and so many of it one place, all aimed at me.

"I don't want to fight you.  I want to find her.  She has to be stopped or she'll give us all away.  You know we can't have that.  The humans aren't ready for dragons, and vampires and werewolves living among them, not to mention all the other scary things that go bump in the night we keep from them.  Just let me go."

The bartender nodded.  I returned the nod and backed up the way the woman dragon had fled.  "You can go.  Don't kill her Feras.  We are trusting you."

"I can't guarantee that.  If she attacks me I will defend myself."

"We know."  The vampire in the corner spoke.  "The Last Phoenix is on our ground, they will let you do your job."

One wolf in the corner stood up.  "The CCB will ensure that the Last Phoenix doesn't retaliate against you Venatori.  Not the whole of your kind, you."

"Thank you."  I gave them both a bow.  They weren't alpha's in their own right, but they would speak to them.  And it was helpful that they knew who I was.  Because I knew people in high places among the vampires and the werewolves.

Once my back was to the opening she had gone through, I turned an looked through, it was the kitchen and there was a door in the back.  I couldn't track her the human way in the City, I needed to use my otherworldly skills and maybe get help from the local police to find where she went.  But the latter was risky for the police and myself.  But we'd do what we had to do.

The back rooms were hot from the nearby kitchen.  I opened my senses and I could smell everything under the sun.  The aroma's from the kitchen alone were over powering, the hot-sauce and garlic were the predominant smells and I needed to leave before I sneezed.

Outside in the alleyway up the stretch near the street entrance stood Walker pacing back and forth.  He saw me and yelled down the alley, "Where the fuck have you been?  She came out way before you.  Did you let her get away?"

"Her friends inside detained me.  I talked my way out, otherwise it would have been a fight."  I grimaced as the smell of putrid garbage wafted my direction.  But I also caught the scent of smoke lingering in the air.  I walked in that direction, , andit was the same way Walker had run, which meant I , andhad our dragon's scent.

Dragon's smelled like smoke - like a forest fire.  But some of them smelled like volcanic smoke filled with ash, you almost wanted to brush your nose from the feeling of the ash all around you.  

I walked past the entrance to the alley and turned left following the scent of the dragon.  Walker fell in step behind me.  "What are you doing?"

"Tracking her."

"How?  There is nothing to track."

"In the City you can't use foot prints you have to use your other senses.  Smell is usually the best one.  Didn't they teach you that?"  I asked out of curiosity.  They hadn't taught me that, I'd picked it up working the streets.  I knew it was something you learned working in the field.  Something they wanted you to figure out.

"No.  I wouldn't even know where to begin, I can't pick out any one scent much less know what a dragon smells like."

"You really are new to hunting in the city aren't you?" 

Walker nodded.  "So tell me what I should be looking for or smelling for in this case?"

I didn't like teaching him because he was a Venatori snob.  What I taught him now could use against innocent supernaturals.  But I sighed and spoke as I turned left down another street.  "Dragon's smell like smoke.  Each kind having their own distinct flavor, but each dragon has their own scent too.  The trick is picking out the different ones."

Walker didn't look like he was trying to track anything, which was for the better right now.  But he asked more intrigued than before, "What do other's smell like?"

"Vampires smell like death.  All new vamps have strong death smells, the older they get the less they do.  I've met an 800 plus vampire who could cover his smell with cologne.  He liked to wear Polo Sport.  Said it was all the rage at home."

"What happened to the vamp?"  Walker asked.

"He bit me and I had to kill him."

"But you were having a conversation with him before that?"

I shook my head with a smirk, "No.  I'd tracked him to a club, and I hit on him to get him outside to kick my ass.  He informed of that me when I told him he smelled good.  And when I continued to hit on him he did want to kick my ass, which I obliged him with by asking him to take it outside with me."  I sighed.  "He got the jump on me, bit a chuck out of my arm and laughed before I took his head off with a razor sharp wire of fire and air.  He fell to the ground in a heap, there wasn't even a drop of blood spilled.  An easy clean up."

Walker frowned.  "Why aren't you dead?"

I smiled.  "I'm not full Venatori.  I guess that's a plus.  Venom from the Vampire bite didn't kill me."

"Have you been bitten by a Therian?"  Walker asked as the scent moved, and it was mingling with other dragon scents.  I had to concentrate a little hard to find the right one.  

I stopped in the middle of the sidewalk and turned with a frown.  "She's up there somewhere."

Walker and I looked up trying to glimpse our dragon against the night sky.  I could illuminate the whole block but that would give me away to her and to the humans around me.  That wouldn't be a good idea I had already been pushing it with telling Sage.  It was best not to push our boundaries.

Walker asked, "Dragons can fly right?  But not in human form?"

I shrugged, "I've never seen one fly in human form, but there is a first time for everything.  Why?"

Walker nodded towards the fire escape, "That's the only one down.  If you think she went up, I think it's the best lead we have right now if she's not shifting into dragon form, which I don't think she did, or we'd have a panicked mass of people here."

"I agree.  Let's go up then." 
We headed for the fire escape and Walker climbed.  I took a deep breath and pushed aside my growing fear and went up myself.

Walker looked down and smiled, "I guess you were right, you don't let things get in your way."

"I conquer my fears, they don't conquer me."  I whispered, but I could hear the fear making my works shake.  But I don't think Walker noticed at least he said nothing.  

We climbed up the fire escape but as we passed a cracked window, I caught her scent again.  "Here," I said and stopped to open the window.  

It was breaking and entering.  We could go to jail if we got caught in the act.  I looked around and saw no one in the immediate vicinity and I drew a veil around us and the fire escape.  It reflected the world back upon itself without me and Walker moving inside of it.  It was invisibility so to speak, but it was just a trick of the eye.  If someone wanted to see us, they could, but a camera's lens would not be fooled.

Walker opened the window and stepped inside first.  There was a sharp scream and then a high hysterical crying sound coming from the room.  Walker was pointing a gun at a man wearing a black leather jacket with the Last Phoenix sewn on.  He was holding a small baby boy as ebony black as the woman and the same golden hair only much shorter in curls.  His orange eyes were drawn to me when I stepped into the room.

"We need to know where she is." I said.  Walker stepped closer with the gun still pointed at them.

The man pulled his son closer, and the boy whimpered and cried.  It alternated between fear and something else.  He shouted at us, "I know what you are.  Naomi said not to tell you anything.  We were safe from you."

I sighed.  "No.  I'm afraid you are not safe from us.  Your son is guilt free and can live a normal life.  You robbed a bank. We will give you over to the human police to be tried in your Naomi's stead.  You can let the world know dragon's exist as a plea for insanity.  No one will believe you.  Tell us where she went.  We know she came here."

The man was human, which made the child a half dragon.  I'd never seen or heard of a surviving half dragon.  I knelt down and looked into the boy's eyes and smiled.  "Your son is special."

He pulled the boy farther from me.  "Get out Feras.  We want nothing to do with you."

"You try very hard to be a dragon don't you?  But you fail.  It's why they won't let you put the mark on your skin.  You are not a dragon."  I had many questions, many things in the supernatural world were changing, were the dragons allowing half human children to survive, and humans among their ranks?  There was a lot to figure out. A war waiting to happen.  There always was in the world humans knew nothing about.

A rock fell down the metal fire escape.  She wanted us away from her family.  "She's baiting us."

I wove weaves of air around the man and the boy.  "You need to stay here.  I'll be back after we got her."

"Don't kill her!" the man pleaded.  

"We'll try not to."

I went out first, I think because I was closer, but I had other reasons to go first.  I was Magnus, I was Cesari, I had the better advantage this time.

We climbed the rest of the fire escape and found Naomi on the roof half in dragon form, half out.  Her body was lined obsidian like scales intermingled with gold ones.  Her large orange eyes were above a reptilian snout.  I'd never seen a half form before.  

Walker had his gun trained on her but she was staring at me.  Her mouth opened and let out a long threatening growl.  I took a step back and wove a wall of air between us.  I'd been burned once too many, and I wasn't about to become fricasseed again.

Naomi spoke in guttural tones of a throat unused to human speech, "Youu.  Will. Not. Take me."  She growled again, and I felt the vibrations through my body.  "The Dragon.  Will.  Never. Die!"  And with the last words she spat out fire from her mouth and a single shot rang out.  I assumed it was Walker's gun going off, but it didn't matter as I lunged for Walker and wove shield of air around us both.  

The flaming breath coiled around the bubble of air and Walker stared at it in amazement as it died down.  His shot had been true, Naomi had only stopped her fire breath because she could no longer breathe.  Her lungs were filling up with blood.  

A gun shot wound would not have made it past a dragon's scales, but it looked like half human scales weren't as strong.

I walked over to her and Walker followed his gun trained on her.  "What does The Dragon want to do?"

She spat at me.  Blood and spittal landed not to far from my foot.

Walker kicked her, "Who's this Dragon?"

I sighed.  "Stop Walker.  The Dragon is an ancient dragon his birth name was Ye Pan.  He runs the Last Phoenix.  He was and always has been a big name in the City.  Though he's never involved himself with robbing banks before."

I looked at Naomi, "I'll keep your son safe.  What does the Dragon want?"

"Humanity will die!"  She growled at me again and snapped.  I sighed and wrapped her mouth and her body in bands of air.

"It looks like a long night."  If there was a conspiracy going down, it was something the Venatori needed to hear, and The Dragon was not some little name to ignore.  I could only hope they saw it the way I did.
