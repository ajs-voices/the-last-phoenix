# Tracking Down the Dragon

Sage had helped me into Dae'lin's office and sat me down in one of her office chairs.  I leaned forward with my head between my knees.  Sage was squatting in front of me looking at me with concern.  I smiled wryly at him trying to reassure him.  But I knew it wasn't working.

"You alright?"

I nodded.  I didn't speak. I wanted to tell Sage that I was okay, that I was good.  I would be okay.  My mind was just over reacting to change to the possibility that my life was going to be completely changed.  The world had been fine until that moment.  Until I had realized with every amount of certainty that I would up root my life to be with him.

Sage's hands were on my knees waiting for me to compose myself.  I reached out and took his hands in mind and pulled him against me.  Sage knelt on the floor between my legs and we were nearly at eye level as I kissed him.  "Change has always been hard."  I whispered after we broke apart.  "I want to be with you and it was a moment of panic realizing I'd do everything I said I would to be with you and I'd never regret it.  But that doesn't mean it doesn't scare the shit out of me."

Sage grinned.  "We aren't making any changes.  Just be with me.  That's enough for me."

"It's enough for me."  I kissed Sage.  Someone cleared their throat in the doorway and we broke apart Sage pressed his face to my chest and took a deep breathe.  It was probably a little embarrassment and a lot more taking comfort in my smell.  I wanted to do the same but I looked up ant saw Dorian standing with a smile.  

"You alright?"  Dorian asked.

"I'm alright.  I have a good man to help me through all this shit."  I smiled up at Dorian then whispered in Sage's ear, "We probably should get to work.  You got that laptop?"

Sage nodded and then kissed me on the neck before he stood up and patted the bag under his arm.  "Two laptops, mine and one for her."  Sage offered me his hand.

I smiled and took it and we followed Dorian out of Dae'lin's office.  Sage squeezed my fingers.  I glanced over at him and he smiled then pulled me closer wrapping his arm around my waist instead of holding my hand.  His hand hung from my belt loop and his fingers wrapped around my hip.  He pressed his hip against mine and we walked.  Sage grinned at me and I couldn't help but smile back at him.  How did I get so lucky to find a guy like him? 

We walked past the fish bowl and Sage stopped.  "That's a dragon?"

I nodded.  "You know her?"

Sage nodded.  "She frequents The Den.  I don't feel other's magic like you do but she always gave off shifter magic vibe.  I know her as Trix."

"So she knows you?" I asked.

Dorian kept walking with a wave.  He had things to do.  He had only come to help me.  I yelled after him.  "Dorian."  He turned and looked at me with a smile and bright blue eyes.  "Thanks for checking on me.  I'll stop by later and we can talk about it."

Dorian laughed.  "I don't think you need my help anymore, Nox.  I think Sage has you well in hand.  But the two of you should stop by for a glass of wine and maybe dinner.  If you feel like cooking."

I nodded.  "We will sometime.  May not be soon, depends on this case."

Dorian nodded.  "Always working.  You are both welcome anytime."  He smiled and turned back down the hall to head back to the Academy where he worked.

Sage had waited patiently for our exchange.  He smiled at me.  "Dinner sounds good.  Maybe I can meet your dad too?"

I grinned.  "I don't know if Dorian would like my father to be in the same room with us.  But we'll get Kai to come around so you can meet him proper."  I nodded towards the girl in the fish bowl.  "She knows Truth?"

Sage nodded.  "She knew Wicked too."

I grinned.  "So she knows The Wicked Truth.  She knew of Chevalier too."

Sage grinned.  "Everyone knows Chevalier who's any good at what we do.  Some say he's as old as computers are and has been hacking them for that long.  Other's say it's just a bunch of guys using the name."

I laughed.  "Which one do you think it is?"  

"Well until yesterday, I would have said he was just a bunch of different guys using the name, but I know better now.  He's the human servant of a vampire and immortal, or at least that's what I understand now."

I nodded.  "Yes.  Cari could let him go and he'd live out his mortal existence, but I doubt Jack Wynn will ever leave Cari's side."

"Is she that good?"  Sage asked.

"She's a very good master.  He makes more money than he could hacking any day.  And he gets to live forever watching technology grow until it kills us all.  He's in heaven."

Sage nodded.  "Shall we go acquaint ourselves then?"

I lead Sage to the door and let him the other side of the air wall and closed the two of us on the inside with the dragon hacker.  I smiled at her.  "Well, Trix.  Here is a computer, and  your babysitter."

She gave Sage a frown.  "I didn't expect you to actually know who The Wicked Truth was.  Or Chevalier.  But you know them both?"  She turned to look at me.

I nodded and I kissed Sage's cheek.  "I know them both."  I winked at her.

Sage sat down next to Trix and slid her a laptop.  "It should be powerful enough."  Sage pulled out his own laptop but kept the lid closed.  He looked up at me.  "We'll need a hard line to your internet."

I nodded to the wall behind them.  "Should be a cable back there.  You both need a hard line?"

Sage nodded.  "Yeah."

I picked up the phone in the conference room and dialed the basement.  

A boy answered.  "IT.  How can I help you?"

"Nate.  I need an Ethernet hub up here in the fishbowl.  I need two hard lines."

Nate was my nephew.  He was my half-sister's eldest son.  He was a Monroe but Iris was a Monroe which tied Nate to the Viddens family through blood.  He sighed.  "When?"

"As soon as possible.  I have two hackers working a case and they don't want a wireless connection." 

"Alright.  I'll bring one up.  I have to take some other things up to HQ anyway."  Nate said as he hung up.

"We'll have a hub in a few minutes.  Get comfortable."  I sat down opposite the two hackers and swiveled in my chair like a child.  Sage chuckled and on one turn I saw Trix rolling her eyes at me.

Ten minutes late a dark haired boy walked into the fishbowl.  Or rather he walked into the wall of air.  I winced when I hard the flesh hit the wall.  "Sorry, my bad."

Nate came in rubbing his nose.  "That's so wrong."

"I'm sorry."

He grinned at me with his crooked smile and green eyes.  "I should let you hang for this Uncle Nox."

I laughed.  He was the only one of the older nephews and nieces that actually called me that.  Darin was Nate's little brother and he'd called me Uncle Nox since he could speak.  But he was 6 now.  He'd been a baby when I first met my father.  "Well.  I do have a bad guy to catch so do whatever you need.  I'll just have Dae'lin call your boss and get it done that way."

The boy paled.  Nate shook his head.  "That's not necessary.  It's right here.  Let me get you set up."

He moved around to the other side of the table where Sage and Trix sat.  He looked at them with wary eyes.  "Which one's the dragon?" he asked.

"Guess." I said.

Nate shook his head.  "I can't tell magic from another, they both possess something."

Sage offered Nate his hand.  "The Wicked Truth."  He nodded towards me.  "He thinks I'm his boyfriend."

Nate took Sage's hand, "Nathaniel Monroe.  Are you?"

Sage grinned.  "Something like that I suppose."

Nate was a smart kid.  "So you must be the dragon."  He indicated Trix, he offered her his hand.  "A pleasure to meet you.  I've never met a dragon before."

"Until today I'd never met a Venatori.  You are the most polite one I've met so far."  Trix said.  "You can call me Vicky."

Nate grinned.  "Don't let Nox bother you, he's just all talk."  Nate went back to work plugging in the hub and provided two more Ethernet cables for the two hackers.  "Here you go.  Two hard lines.  Good luck!"

"Uncle Nox, Mom said you need to cook dinner for the family soon.  Not just us, but everyone.  A real family dinner.  She said you were the only one qualified."  Nate said at the door.

I laughed.  "Tell her to put it on my schedule and I'll be there.  We can plan the menu after we get a solid date."

Nate's eyes went wide.  "Really?  Even Uncle Adam?"

"He's my half-brother we might as well try to get along."  I said.  "You get everyone in one place and I'll cook.  One big happy family."

Nate's smile was bright.  "I'll tell mother.  She'll be just as surprised."  He literally skipped out the door.

I looked to the girl dragon and smiled.  "Trix you wanna get started?"

She smiled back.  "You could have used my name."

I shrugged.  "You didn't introduce yourself to me.  And I have no intention of telling you Truth's real name so I figure I'll stick to your handle as well."

Sage grinned at me.  "She's working on setting up."  He turned his laptop for me to see and he was networked into whatever she was doing.  "I got a visual of everything she's doing.  What do you want me to do?"

"Just babysit I guess."  I smiled at him. "It's about all I got right now.  Work with her if you see that you can."

Sage sighed and walked around the table and sat down next to me.  He pulled his laptop closer so he could see and turned my chair to him and leaned closer.  I leaned in so he could whisper as that was the vibe he was giving me.  "Nox.  I can do whatever you need me to do."

I grinned at him and whispered, "My Wicked Truth.  I don't want to get you in trouble.  You know what I need.  You do what you think you can do for me without compromising your morals."

Sage was grinning at me.  "Your Wicked Truth?"

"Yes.  Mine."  I smiled

"I like that."  Sage kissed my check and turned back to his laptop.  "Let me see what I can do."

I whispered, "Don't compromise yourself for me.  Are we clear?"

Sage nodded.  "I understand."

Sage and Trix started working and the only sound in the room was that of typing. 

After twenty minutes Trix broke the verbal silence.  "Can I get some Mountain Dew and chocolate?"

I nodded.  "You want anything Truth?"

"Coffee, please."

"Alright.  I'll get you some hacker food."  I stood up and left the room.   

I knocked on Dae'lin's door.  "I need to get some caffeine for the computer geeks to make progress.  Someone needs to make sure Truth stays safe."

Dae'lin nodded.  "I'll watch him myself."  She opened the door and removed the air weave and replaced it with her own.  She sat down at the head of the table and watched the progress while I headed down to the cafeteria.

I ordered a pizza from the cefetria in addition to picking up mountain dew, chocolate and coffee.  I also picked up a few protein bars as it might be awhile for anything else other than that.  I didn't mind being an errand boy.  But I would prefer to remain with Sage while he was in the presense of an enemy dragon.

Dae'lin and Sage were chatting when I walked in.  She smiled up at me.  "Your friend here has found a legal means of fixing our problem."  She stood up and shook Sage's hand.  "Thank you Truth.  You certainly are a useful person to have around."

I put down a bottle of Mountain Dew for Trix and the chocolate she asked for.  I'd actually gotten M&M's, Milk and Dark Chocolate for her to choose from since I wasn't sure what she wanted.  I gave Sage his coffee and he smiled back at me.  "I ordered pizza for later - figured everyone ate pizza."

Trix just smiled and sipped at her drink.  "He's hard to find.  Truth I could use your help."

Sage looked at the screen that was her and nodded.  There was no small talk as the two hackers started back again at their jobs.

I sat down and watched Sage.  I didn't really understand anything that was going on.  But I could see the patterns in the code.  The way things returned.  How his gift manipulated the data stream as it left his fingers.  He manipulated the computer as much as he did the code.  It made me wonder how much of it was his knowledge or his gift.

I put my hand on his shoulder and he glanced at me.  "I have a question when you have a moment."

Sage finished up.  He nodded. "What's up?"

"Do you know you are using your ability?  I mean are you knowingly manipulate the machine while you are writing code?"

Sage looked at me with a questioning look and shook his head.  "I guess not since I'm not doing anything different since I found out I was a technopath."

I nodded.  "I can find you a technopath to show you."

"If you like.  I guess it would be good to know what's going on."  Sage smiled.

I stood up and let them get back to work.  "I'm just going to be outside the door."  I stepped outside and let the glass door close behind me.  I called the one person who I knew could help Sage in the long run.  I could have called Ant to get us in touch, but then I'd have to explain to Ant and he'd have to explain to Jack and then it wouldn't necessarily translate right.

So I dialed Jack's personal number.  He answered, "You know I'm in Italy right?"

"Yes, Jack I know.  I've a question/favor to ask of you of a personal nature not business related."

"Color me intrigued.  Let me guess you want me to hook you up with Truth."  Jack giggled over the line.

"Actually, no.  I managed that all on my own well before you introduced me." 

"So Ant tells me.  What do you want then?"  Jack asked.

"My Wicked Truth is a technopath.  But he was never taught control or even what he's doing.  He eventually managed to take control of his power and stop damaging everything, but he's clueless to it.  He didn't know until I said something."

Jack sighed.  "His parents should have taught him.  It's a recessive genetic trait.  The likely hood of it transmitting into a family without the knowledge of what they are is very rare, even if it skips a generation."

I nodded knowingly.  "His parents died when he was three.  He bounced around foster care systems until he got caught hacking, and his adoptive parents took him in and later adopted him."

"Fuck!" Jack blurted out.  "Yeah.  I can help him when I get back.  But I don't know how much help I'm going to be if he's already using it."

"Show him how you use it.  Teach him to see it.  He doesn't know what he's doing it's instinctive, don't change that, just help him see it."  I said.

Jack laughed.  "I've always wanted to meet the Wicked Truth in person.  I hear he's hot."

I rolled my eyes.  "He is.  He's mine."

Jack laughed.  "We'll see about that.  Maybe he'd make a good master."

"Jack, he's mine."  I said flattly.

"Yeah, yeah.  You won't share?"  He joked.

"Not on your life."  I smiled. "Thank you Jack.  I owe you."

Jack laughed.  "Me personally?"

I nodded. "Yes Jack.  I owe you.  Not Cari, not Ant - you!"

"Wow!  A Venatori favor of my very own.  I know what I can ask of you, but I won't - not yet anyway.  I might think up something else."  Jack hung up the phone before I could comment on it.  Jack's sort of payment could be very dangerous.

I went back into the fishbowl and sat down next to Sage.  He grinned at me, "What was that about?"

"Told you I'd find you a technopath.  He's in Italy right now but when he gets back he said he'd help."

Sage turned to look at me, "You mean Chevalier is a technopath."

I nodded.  "Yeah.  He is."

"I thought other magic didn't work on human paths."  Sage said confused.

"That's true most of the time.  I think that most species don't want to contaminate themselves with human magic honestly that's what the Aeternus did when they created the Venatori.  Primeval vamps and the First therians and the dragons really, don't want to dilute their lines with the mortality of the human race."  I grinned.  "But that's my theory."

Sage asked, "So you think, if they'd tried I could have been a wolf?"

I shrugged.  "Yeah.  But we'll never know.  Unless that's what you want?"

Sage shook his head. "I think I have a problem turning furry once a month."

I grinned.  "Nothing wrong with turning furry once a month.  It comes with other advantages as well."

"Are you trying to talk me into it?"  Sage laughed.

"Not at all.  I'm just saying if the only thing you see as a negative is turning furry once a month then there might be room for Danny and Adrian to convince you otherwise."

Sage shook his head.  "Maybe before I met you I might have taken the risk.  But I don't want to die now."

I grinned.  "Well I'd help you through it if you wanted me there.  But all in all it's your decision and I'm happy with you the way you are so I'm not trying to talk you into anything."

Sage nodded and stared at his screen like he was thinking.  I didn't know what he was thinking about - and I wasn't about to ask.  It was his decision.

Trix and Sage worked on the task at hand until pizza arrived when they both took a break to eat.  They two hackers chatted back and forth and I listened.  I felt very much like an outsider and a jailer.  I wasn't part of their world and I didn't understand.  But I wasn't going to leave Sage alone with someone who could potentially harm him.

I wasn't bored.  I had plenty to entertain me while they worked.  I tried to follow Sage's screen but I still got lost in things.  He'd look over at me and explain what they were doing like he was teaching some other hacker.  I wasn't always sure he was talking to me but most of the time he was.  I could tell by the tone of his voice - soft and caring and trying to help me understand.

It was the thought that counted.  I didn't understand and really my simple minded brain wasn't connecting on the totality of it all.  But I understood the repetitive patterns of their tasks.  I enjoyed watching Sage.  The way his hands moved across his keyboard.  The way he scrunched his nose when he was thinking hard and trying to focus on something.

He would catch me staring at him and blush slightly before going back to work.  But he never said anything.  But even that got boring after a while.  I started playing with patterns juggling balls of air and fire to kill time.  Watching them mingle and dissipate as I let them fizzle out.  

I found Sage and Trix watching me as the last ball popped out over my head.  Trix laughed, "He's a clown."

Sage chuckled.  "We have a place."

"Why didn't you say something?"  I asked.

Trix laughed.  "We were going to until you started playing games, and it looked like you were having so much fun we didn't want to distract you."

Sage smiled as I looked at him for confirmation.  "You were just too cute oblivious to everything else."

I preened under the admission and grinned at him.  "Of course I was.  That's no excuse.  Well?"

Trix said.  "He's got a lot of business all around.  He's currently at the Empire State Building office."  She popped an M&M into her mouth and smiled.  "Am I done now?"

I smiled at her.  "For now.  Play nice and I'll be back in a moment."

I looked at Sage.  "You feel safe?"

Sage nodded.  "She won't hurt me.  Besides there are like ten Venatori standing around watching us at all times."

I frowned.  "Sorry.  Trix, I promise a deal.  No death sentence.  Even if I have to make you leave the country."

Trix frowned but nodded.  I smiled.  "I do thank you.  Let me do my thing and I'll be back."

They both nodded and started typing away at their computers again.  I think they were talking about me but whatever.  I left them both in an unprotected room and hoped that no one would hurt either of them while I wasn't watching them.  I stepped into Dae'lin's office and smiled.  "They got a location.  We need to stop him before he finds out Trix turned on him."

Dae'lin nodded and was on the phone.  I spoke while she dialed.  "I'm going to go see Walker.  Keep an eye on the dynamic duo please."

Dae'lin nodded and started her conversation on the other side of the phone.  I headed up to the Infirmary, but I stopped wondering if Sage wanted to come with me.  I turned back and found that there was another hunter in the room with the two hackers.

I opened the door and the conversation stopped.  The man looked at me and raised his hands in self defense. "I'm just a techy.  Hoping they can help me."

"Trix you want to help him?"  I asked.

"Isn't that why I'm here?  To make myself useful."  

I smiled.  "Add it to good behavior.  Truth, you want to come with me to check on Walker?"

Sage stood up immediately.  "Yes.  I need to stretch my legs."

I nodded to the tech guy.  "There are others watching if you feel threatened, but I think Trix here understands the deal."

He nodded and sat down next to her and they resumed their conversation.  I held the door for Sage and he stepped out of the fishbowl into the hallway, taking my hand as he passed by.

I grinned over at him as we walked.  "You like touching me don't you?" I asked him.

He smiled.  "Yes, but it's more for you than me"

"Me?"  I asked curious.

"Yeah.  You've been eying me all afternoon and keeping your hands to yourself.  I figured I'd reward your accomplishment."

I grinned at him.  "I can handle that."

I lead Sage to the stair well and we went up one flight before I stopped on the landing between floors and pushed Sage up against the wall.  He grinned at me.  "I was wondering how long it would take you before you did that."  He laughed.

Sage leaned forward and kissed me.  He turned me around and I was pressed up against the wall my hands above my head.  His face was close to mine when he pulled away.  "I think I like this view better."  Sage said.  "Stay this way for me." He trailed his fingers down my arms and I shuddered.  His hands payed with the hem of my shirt before he slipped his hands under my shirt.  My hands flexed above my head as I wanted to touch him but I obeyed.  Sage's fingers caressed the sides of my body and and abs.  He licked my lips and grinned.  "So pliant.  God, I'd love to do so much more right now."

My response came out in a hushed breathless whisper, "Why don't you?"


Sage laughed against my next.  "Because we are in a stairwell.  And you have a job to do."  Sage pulled away from me leaving my body cold and wanting.  I stayed where he'd put me and Sage grinned.  "So hot."  He licked his lips.  "So obedient too.  I think I like that more than I thought."  Sage held out his hand.  "Come on, let's go."

I sighed but I complied and took his hand. Shaking the blood back down into my arms.  "Does that bother you?"

I shook my head.  "No.  It's all part of the fun."

"You like when I take charge?"  Sage asked.

I smiled reassuringly.  "You know I do.  If it bothers you don't do it, Sage.  I'm happy either way."

Sage stopped me and pushed me against the side of the stair well, the railing pressing awkwardly into my back.  He grinned.  "I don't mind.  I like what it does to you."

I bit my bottom lip.  "What does it do to me, Sage?"

Sage laughed as he took a step back.  I remained with my back against the wall awkwardly and watched as Sage looked me up and down.  The look on his face told me he enjoyed my reaction very much.  My pants were getting tighter with each passing glance. "Mmmmm."  Sage shook his head bringing his eyes to rest on mine.  "What I'd love to do to you.  But..."  Sage sighed.  "Let's go see Walker."  He offered me his hand again and I took it with a smile.

I whispered softly, "My body is yours.  Anything and everything you wish to do to it is yours for the taking."

Sage laughed to cover the groan that had tried to escape.  "Work."

I grinned as I opened the door to the Infirmary floor Walker was on.  Sage never dropped my hand as we walked past the nurse's station and into Walker's room.

The IV drip from before was gone and Walker was actually up and pulling on a button up shirt over his well defined body.  Sage caught me looking and chuckled to himself.   He spoke first, "Glad to see you are up and about, Walker.  From the sounds of it you shouldn't be."

Walker laughed.  "I wouldn't be if it weren't for your boy's quick thinking.  Nox, really saved my bacon."

Sage grinned, "And a nice piece of bacon it is."

Walker turned around with red creeping up his face.  I wasn't sure if it was embarrassment or anger, or maybe a little of both.  But he saw the look on Sage's face and burst out laughing.  "I take it your boy toy was looking too hard at my nakedness."

Sage grinned.  "At least you were mostly dressed."

I rolled my eyes.  "I can't help noticing."

Walker laughed, "That's the kinda things that gets you into trouble, Nox."  Walker walked out of his hospital room and there were about three nurses who got up out of their chairs where they were working and rushed after him.  "Mr. Moore you can't leave."  one nurse said as she rushed after him.

I followed Walker and the nurses, Sage was still holding my hand as we walked behind them.  "I think he has other ideas."

We walked into the stair well and the nurses followed.  Walker walked all the way to Dae'lin's office before the nurses turned back in defeat.  Walker turned to us, "So what's on deck?"
