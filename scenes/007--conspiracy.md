# Conspiracy

I didn't want Walker alone with any of the dragons or the human.  He might off and pop them because he could.  But the humans needed a scapegoat, and this man would provide one.  And the boy, I didn't want him to get hurt; he was only a kid.

"We are really going to question her?"  Walker asked.

"You heard her, there is something more going on.  We need to understand."  I shrugged.  

"Normally, I'd just call a cleanup crew," he added.

I smiled.  "We can walk them right in the back door."  I wove a platform of air and tied her arms and legs to it with more air and she floated with us as we climbed down the fire escape ladders to the living apartment again.

The man and the boy walked in front of Walker and I lead with the floating tied dragon behind me.  But no one saw us.  The veil was thick around us, people saw what they expected to see.  It was a good trick.  Some vampires had a similar ability.  I had only met one who could do it well, but there were rumors that Il Cane could hid in plain sight of any Venatori and no one would ever find her.  She was meant to scare you, her powers were godlike for a reason - she was the singular forced that kept the vampires in line.  Their council sent her after the big bad vampires.  She did what we did for all the races.  And I had hunted her once.

It was a good memory.  Every new Venatori out in the field is given a list of names to hunt and kill with a mentor beside them.  And every new hunter gets one name - Il Cane or more importantly her real name - Cari Giovanni.  

It's a trick test to see how many people take forever to figure out who she is and that it was a test.  Most people fail it.  They either try to hunt her down and fail, or they fail to recognize who she is and their mentors just out right tell them.

I fell into both categories.  I hunted Il Cane, however I knew who I was hunting.  When Michaela told me to give it up I did, but once I completed my first assignments, I hunted her.  It was a test of my skill.

Between my cases, I tracked Il Cane to Florida, where she keeps a large estate.  One to which I've been on.

I didn't find her, but I found her son.  Figlio del Cane, Ant Giovanni, was legendary in and of himself, the only born vampire who couldn't walk in daylight.  He stalled me and told me to stop hunting his mother.  She had sent him to let me know I had done better than any other hunter - in her life time.  It was high praise.  Ant and I hung out for a few weeks comparing notes on our jobs and we worked together whenever I had a vampire case.  

It was a good memory, and it had taken me all the way home with little incident.  Walker had said nothing to pull me out of my memories while we returned to the Apex Unlimited Building.  The back doors shielded  Venatori guards on the inside from view. They shook their heads as they saw me and my now human dragon behind me.  She'd thought to escape my bonds of air with the shift.  When that failed she moaned in subjecation.  I wasn't an idiot, the bonds reacted to all her movements - never too tight, never too loose..

Walker and I lead the three dragon conspirators upstairs to HQ.  We took the elevator - it was faster than taking the 20 plus floors and I wasn't sure the human man would make it.

I knew we ascended in the service elevator, but my heart didn't race when I didn't see the floor getting smaller below us.

My phone blipped a text from an unknown number and I smiled as the doors opened.  I'd have to take a look at it later, when I didn't have a dragon to contend with.

Dae'lin and Gary greeted us - the two heads of the field hunting office.  Gary had a frown on his face, and Dae'lin remained neutral, she was used to my presents.

"Why are you bringing us three detainees?"  Gary asked.  His voice sounded sleepy.  I was glad someone woke him up.  It was already a long night for us.  Let someone else join in on our misery.

"This is the dragon who we caught on camera that Walker's been tracking down. She attacked us, Walker shot her, I'd have let him finish her, but she mentioned The Dragon and humanity dying.  She won't speak to us.  At least not before she dies.  She needs help.  I've done what I can to ease her pain and clear her breathing but she'll die and she had important information."

Gary asked, "Why the human and the boy?"  Walker had the same question in his eyes but he hadn't asked it before.  A show of solidarity with the detainees.  It was noble of him.

"The humans need to catch someone for the bank robberies.  He's your man.  Spin the story he's the mastermind.  Plant the evidence - the usual and you satisfy the cops.  The boy is just that, a boy.  I couldn't leave him in the house alone."

Gary was fuming now, there was a pulsing in the vein in his neck that made me think of drinking blood.  A vampire would very much like this state of Gary.  "What the fuck am I supposed to do with a dragon boy?"

"Put him in with the toddlers until the dragons can come get him."

Naomi squirmed and thrashing in her bonds at what I'd said.  The human man cried out, "They'll kill him."

I smiled.  "If you cooperate, then I'm sure we can work something out to save your son."

Gary frowned and pushed me back in the elevator.  "Dae'lin take the bonds.  He's making offers no one can keep.  Get now!  Walker come with us.  Explain things."

Walker nodded, "Yes, sir."

Dae'lin gave me a smile.  "Enjoy your birthday, Nox."

I frowned at her as I walked out of the elevator and headed towards the stairs to go back to my room.

I took my phone out and open the text Sage had sent me earlier  when I ran into someone.  I apologized and moved without ever looking up, but the man stepped into my way and I looked up.

When I saw who I'd run into, I took a step backwards. I hated that smile on his face.  He spoke with feigned happiness, "Well, hello, Nox."

"Garrett." I said as I felt the fear rise inside.

He laughed.  "What are you doing up at this hour?"

"I was working."  I blurted. The need to be elsewhere grew inside.  I could feel my heart racing and I knew I was sweating, I could feel my shirt clinging to my skin.

"A case kept you out?  Not your birthday?"  He asked like he was interested in the answer.

"Yeah.  We were scouting out a known location - a bar - of a target."  

"You weren't seeing your blue-eyed friend?"  Garrett asked.

How the fuck did he know about Sage?  Did he see him coming or going from my apartment?  I frowned.  "I wasn't with my friend.  I was with Walker Moore.  He couldn't find a dragon.  I was helping him."

"Walker Moore?"  He nodded as if he understood, "I didn't think you worked with anyone."

"I don't.  Dae'lin assigned me."  I moved to the side, "I'm tired.  I want to go now."

He smiled at me.  I winched as he put his hand on my shoulder.  I saw the laughter in his eyes but he never did more than touch me.  He was trying to scare me.  "By all means.  Sleep."  I didn't like that smile on his face.

I nodded my head and pulled away from his grip.  "Good night, Garrett."  I hurried into the stairwell and took the stairs three at a time until I reached my floor.  But once up there I stopped and leaned against the wall and slide down with my knees against my chest and my head tucked between my knees.  Why did he always make me feel like I was five again?  I closed my eyes for a few moments.

My phone buzzed again, and I pulled it out of my pocket and glanced at the time.  What the fuck, it was 4 am already?  I didn't remember falling asleep but I must have.  It wasn't that late when we got back. 

I glanced at the reason my phone had disturbed me and I saw a second message from Sage.

I sighed. Three hours of time lost in the stair well.  I had to look like shit, my body ached and my butt was numb from sitting on the cold concrete floor of the stair well.

I didn't get an immediate reply, so I got up and opened the door to the hall and headed for my apartment.  My phone buzzed that annoying I don't know who you are text as I unlocked the door.  I looked at it once I got inside and shut the door behind me. I got up and opened the door to the hall and headed for my apartment.

I removed the white over shirt and tossed it into the hamper and removed my jeans and shoes and flopped down on my bed while I waited for Sage to text back.  Maybe he had fallen asleep.

I held up the phone above me and took another selfie as promised.  My bed.  It was 4 am, and I was just going to bed.  I hadn't done this in years.

I sent the selfie to Sage.

> 4:35 AM  

I crawled under my orange comforter and the peach sheet underneath and curled around a pillow not expecting to hear my phone ring.  I answered it without thinking.

"Hey."

Sage answered back, "Hey. I'm sorry you had a shitty night.  Can I make your day any better?"

Sage couldn't see my drowsy smile. "Maybe after a few hours of sleep."  It was my birthday after all and I had nothing else planned except more work.

"Do you want to stop by?  We can get a bite to eat...  Nox?"

I startled.  "I'm here.  Sorry, in that post panic state, I'm drained.  I'll call you when I wake up, all right?  We can do something."

Sage breathed a sigh of relief.  "All right.  Call me.  Good night, Nox."

I smiled, and I wished I could see those beautiful blue eyes in front of me, "Night, Sage."  The phone went dead, and I curled around the pillow again with the phone tucked under it in my hand like it was the only thing holding me to the mysterious blue-eyed boy.

I dreamt of him.  And  then the blue eyes instead of the red floated towards me.  The flashes of fire and earth across my skin.  The blue eyes startling me awake when they didn't reveal the face I expected.

I woke with my heart in my throat, my bed was soaking wet from sweat.  My t-shirt and boxers clung to my skin and there was a pounding on my apartment door.  Or maybe that was my head.

I clutched my phone in my hand and there was new text.

The knocking started again, and bewilderment set in.

> Yeah.  I'd love some, when?

Two minutes ago?  The pounding stopped at my door.

> ****  
> Open the door.  
> 8:34 AM  

I was not awake, but I went to the door and opened it to find Sage standing outside with two cups of hot coffee from a shop downstairs and that gorgeous smile.  
I looked at my phone then back up at Sage still not comprehending what happened. The vestages of my last dream lingered and everything was a blur.

I moved aside and took the coffee Sage offered me.  His smile faded when he looked at me.  "A little bird told me it was your birthday today. She said to come by in four hours.  Is this all right?"

I nodded and sipped the cup.  It was warm and smelled wonderful.  I hadn't realized the coffee downstairs was so good.  "You look worse than before." Sage whispered.

I sat down on my bed and fished out my notebook under the pillow and took it to the bar and sat down.  "Was woken by a nightmare."

Sage sat down next to me and watched as I pulled the pencil from the spiral bindings and opened to the last page.  I sketched the new image from my dream.  It wasn't much different, only the color was different, everything else had been the same.

When the image was complete, I went to the bedside stand and fished out the blue pencils and colored the eyes in their new shade. I went to the bedside stand and fished out the blue pencils and colored the eyes in their new shade.

Sage was frowning at the drawing when I put the last pencil down.  "All the others are red?"

I nodded.  I was still processing it.  "I was thinking about you when I fell asleep."

Sage touched the notebook, "May I?"  He looked at me, the fear in his eyes was apparent.  

I nodded.  

He pulled it close and flipped a few pages back, and then more, and then to the beginning.  "The same dream every night?"

"It varies some, but yeah."

"Jesus, Nox.  Does anyone know?"

"Everyone does.  I've been sketching them since I was 6."

"Everything aside, they are pretty good."  Sage smiled at me and put his hand on mine and squeezed.  "Can I help?"

I smiled. "You already have."  I held up the cup of coffee and ran my finger down the side of his clean shaven jawline.  A visible shiver ran down his body and I grinned at his reaction which made me bite my bottom lip.

Sage chuckled.  "So what do you want to do today?  Mia texted me and said no one would make you work on your birthday.  Something about rules."

"More like tradition.  But the rest of the day is mine." I laughed to myself, when Sage gave me the cockeyed puppy dog look I answered the unspoken question, "I'm surprised Mia is pushing so hard.  She is very big on me marrying and starting a family.  Always asking when I'll find Mrs. Right and settle down."

Sage smiled.  "Go get a shower and I'll take you out for breakfast."

I nodded with a grin.  "All right."

I took a quick shower.  Or what I thought was quick anyway.  I hadn't considered that it might be 30 minutes under the water, I had zoned out a little under the hot stream against my skin. The hot water stung the fresh scars on my back.  They had healed as they had formed but they were tender under the heat and pressure.

I wiped the mirror down and looked at my back in the mirror and saw two new pink welts, they didn't look like they'd broken the skin, which was why there had been no blood.  That they were still tender meant it was strikes in the same place.  I pulled all the elements around me and pressed them like a cold compress to the welts in my back and I watched as the tender redness faded.  It healing faster than normal.

Magnus couldn't heal.  Not in a traditional sense.  A human would die from wounds if I were to do the same thing to them.  I was providing the material for my body's already rapid healing, it was still doing the work.  It was the reason I had survived the vampire bite I'd told Walker about.  It was when I first realized I could do this.  I had received no new scars since I'd learned that trick.

The story goes, a vamp had taken a chunk from my arm.  I was in such a rush to get to the infirmary in Boulder I hadn't thought about it.  I stuffed my wound full of the elements to keep it from bleeding and me from dying.  By the time I looked down again it was healed.  I thought it was a freak accident until I did it again with a knife wound I'd given myself in the kitchen.  until I did it again with a knife wound I'd given myself in the kitchen. 

There was a knock on the door, "You okay, Nox?"

I pulled a pair of clean boxers on and applied the swath of eyeliner.  "Yeah.  You can come in."

There would be no lies.  If he would leave me he needed to do it sooner rather than later.  I was too attached already.  I dreamt about him.  He was prying hisself into my life and I didn't want him to leave.  It was better if he left afraid of what was in store now rather than later.

Sage opened the door and in the few seconds it took to allow him entrance Sage had seen what covered my back and he was hissing in pain as the door closed behind him.  There was no one there, but he had locked it like he was hiding me from the world.  It brought a frown to my lips as I applied eyeliner to the other eye. 

Sage ran his fingers down my back and I froze.  He pulled his fingers away, but I didn't relax.  "Do you want to talk about it?" he asked.

"No.  But if you want to know I'll tell you."  I smiled to take some of the sting out of my words.

Sage smiled and kissed the puckered skin between my shoulder blades.  "When you are ready, I'd like to know.  Can I help?"

"Help?"  I asked.

He turned me around and took the eyeliner pencil from my hands and grinned. "Help."

I shrugged.  Sage traced the black pencil under my left eye.  

I broke the silence and told Sage the reason for the scars that made up my back.  "When I was five, I sparked - used my magic for the first time.  My mother sent me here.  My first teacher's job was to insure I was safe to be around others.  That I had complete control of my ability."  I swallowed hard and  continued to stare at the man doing my make up because I could do nothing else and finished my story in a hushed voice.  "He had to find what made me spark out of control.  When he found it he used it from a year to insure I never lost control of my ability."

"So for a year he beat you?"  Sage barked and took a step back his hands clenched at his sides.

I nodded.  "On the last day, he tried to hit me again, as one final test, before he did I sparked again.  Except it wasn't on accident.  I did it on purpose to hurt him.  When the fire alarms started fear lanced through me and I put the fire out.  But it wasn't an accident.  I was six then.  I went to the detention center for three months with mandatory therapy sessions with Dr. Silverman - Margo.  When I returned to the general population of the Academy, I had a new mentor and was to repeat my first year of fire-starter training again.  Which I was okay with.  But that's when the nightmares started.  Sometimes when they come, I hurt myself like he used to hurt me.  Margo's studied the effects of the nightmare and I am the one doing it to myself."

Sage was just staring at me when I finished.  I looked down and waited for him to walk out disgusted.  There were only two people in the world that knew my secret and neither of them would tell a soul.  I was trusting a complete stranger with my biggest and darkest secret and he was just staring at me.

Two fingers touched my chin and Sage lifted my eyes to his.  He smiled.  He finished the other eye in silence.  I couldn't bring myself to speak anymore.  

When Sage finished, he leaned forward and kissed my lips.  "Why were the eyes blue this time?"  His lips were still so close to mine as he stared into my eyes.  All I could see were his beautiful eyes. 

I whispered, "I'd been thinking about you."

Sage frowned, but he pressed his lips against mine again and whispered, "I will never hurt you like that."

I grinned at him when he pulled away.  "I know.  Or rather I didn't think you would.  The fear morphed from the demon in my dream because I'm afraid of you hurting me in other ways.  It's just my fear of rejection manifesting in the only way my brain knows how to process it."

"Nox," Sage smiled, "I won't intentionally hurt you, now or in the future.  I get that you fear being dumped, we all do.  But we'll talk about everything before it ends.  Can we make that deal?"

I nodded.  "Yeah."

Sage grabbed my hand and lead me out of the bathroom door to my dresser.  "Get dressed.  Let's get breakfast.  I'm starving."

I pulled on a pair of ripped blue jeans and a dark gray t-shirt that read 'I make adorable babies'. When I turned to face Sage, he was grinning from ear to ear at my shirt.  I walked to the closet and pulled out skeleton hoodie and pulled it over my arms. 

Sage was shaking his head when I turned around, "You know it's like 75 right?"

I nodded.  "I don't like my arms or back exposed."

"You ready?" he asked.

I sat down on the bed and pulled on my Nike's and nodded.  "I am now."  Sage took my hand and entwined our fingers together.  I picked up my phone, keys and my wallet and shut the lights off and the door behind us.  This was the second date I hadn't planned in the same amount of days.

We walked through the halls hand in hand.  Sage headed for the elevator and I followed him a step behind him.  He pressed the button and then he squeezed my hand, "What's bothering you?"

I grinned.  "Is it that obvious?"

"You are trembling."

"Afraid of heights.  This elevator is the worst for my fears.  But I'll be okay."  I smiled at Sage.

The elevator doors slide open and a familiar face stood inside.  I smiled as we stepped inside.  "Hey, Dorian."  

Dorian smiled.  "Nox.  I see you have company again."

"Dorian, this is Sage Morgan."  Dorian offered his hand as I continued.  "Sage, this is Dorian Vega, my mentor."  

Sage spoke first as he took Dorian's hand.  "I've heard a lot about you."

"All good, I hope."  Dorian shook Sage's hand.

Sage laughed.  "Yeah, how your helped him through trying times."  Sage wrapped his arm around my waist and rubbed the small of my back and I froze.  My heart raced and my breathing increased.  I tried not to let any of it show.  Dorian's eyes went wide but Sage didn't seem to notice as he was looking at the statue in the middle of the lobby.  "Nox really make that down there?"

Dorian nodded and Sage pulled me closer when he realized I was having a panic attack.  He stopped rubbing my back and just held me against him.  I smelled his laundry detergent on his clothes, and the lavender and jasmine of his shampoo and bodywash. Leaning against him I buried my face into his neck.  I smiled against his soft skin.  

Dorian answered, "He did.  It was spectacular.  No one believed a ten-year-old did it."  Dorian chuckled, "You handle him well."

I laughed.  "You have no idea, Dorian.  No fucking idea."

Sage kissed my cheek.  "I try."

We hit the level of the Academy and Dorian stepped off the elevator.  He turned around and held the door open as he spoke to Sage.  "You take care of him on his birthday.  Make sure he doesn't do anything stupid."

"Yes, sir."  Sage smiled against my neck.  When the door closed Sage asked, "Do you want me to stop touching your back?  I keep forgetting."

I whispered in his ear, "No."

Sage pulled me away so he could see my face. "No what?"

I smiled and gave him a soft peck on the lips, "Don't stop."

Sage grinned, and I leaned back against him and buried my face in the crook of his neck.  It was not my usual pose, it felt good having someone taller than me for once.  His hand went under my hoodie and my t-shirt to the top of my waist band and his fingers rubbed against the rough puckered skin of the slash marks that ran just below the line.  My bodied stilled and my breathing increased but I hummed into his neck encouraging him despite my bodies reaction.  Sage whispered, "You know, I don't think I've ever been with a guy who was quite so open about public displays of affection in today's world."

I hummed against his neck and bit it.  "I usually play up the gay. Though, I'm not playing anything right now though."

The elevator doors opened at the lobby level and I untangled myself from Sage's body and we disembarked.  There was a small crowd waiting for the elevator but that was the extent of the people who saw us up close and personal.

Sage took my hand with a smile.  "There's a great place across the street."

I laughed.  "I don't think I've ever been there for breakfast."

Sage smiled, "It's fantastic."

We walked across the street when the lights changed down the block.  Traffic was never empty in the City, but at least we could cross without getting hit.

The door gave off that familiar little tinkle as we opened it and stepped inside the old school dinner.  The red neon letters outside in fancy script read "Bonnie's Diner".  Bonnie had owned the place for many years.  I had come here many times throughout my days in the Academy to eat and study where no one would bother me.

Bonnie looked up from reading the morning paper and blinked at us.  She smiled.  "Never thought I'd see the pair of you together.  Take a seat boys."

Sage laughed.  "You are a regular too?"

"Just not at breakfast."  I smiled as I sat down with my back to the door.

Sage nodded his head to move in. I laughed.  "If you are going to sit with me we should sit on the other side then."

Sage gave me a strange look but backed up from the table so I could get out and switch sides.  I smiled at him and took his hand to follow me in.  "I don't like my back to the door, but I was letting you have the better seat."

"Ah."  Sage grinned and squeezed my hand.  "I never understood the convention of sitting across from someone."

Bonnie came over and stood over the table. "It allows for easier and more intimate conversation.  I don't suspect either of you boys care too much for intimate conversation.  Always coming in with your books and your laptops to work."

I grinned up at her, "I like intimate conversation.  I like Sage."

She asked, "Your usual, Nox?"

I shook my head. "Not quite.  I'll take steak and eggs and whatever fresh fruit you have.  Coffee please and a glass of water."

She looked over at Sage with a smile.  "Your usual, hun?"

"Yes, ma'am.  Though his sounds reall good."

Bonnie left and took our orders with her.  She brought coffee over and poured two black cups before she left.  My leg pressed against Sage's and it was difficult to move without elbowing him.  Sage had elbowed me three times in that short time.  "Maybe this isn't as easy as I'd like it to be," Sage said.

"I don't mind."  I leaned back and put my arm around Sage on the top of the booth's bench.  "Is this how you sit when you are on dates?"

Sage nodded.  "I like to touch my partner.  Playing footsie and holding hands is nice and all, but I'd rather be able to do this."  He leaned over and kissed me hard on the mouth.  My body reacted and I brought my other hand up around his neck holding him close and deepening the kiss.  His tongue darted into my mouth and I let out a small moan.  

By the time Sage pulled away my knees felt weak, and I had to catch my breath.  Sage's lips were swollen from kissing me and I bit my bottom lip at the look on his face.  God, I wanted him.  I grinned at him.  "I didn't expect that."

Sage grinned.  "It's your birthday."

"I could think of something else you could do for my birthday."  I said with a wink.

Sage leaned in and whispered in my ear, "Nope.  Not yet."

I laughed.  "I didn't think so."  I took a sip of my coffee and smiled at Sage.  "I am good with that."

Bonnie brought our breakfast and sat it down in front of each of us with a tall chocolate shake with two straws.  

I looked up at her and rolled my eyes.  She interrupted before I could say anything at all.  "It's your birthday.  Indulge me."

"Yes, ma'am."  I picked up the shake and took a sip of it, then smiled at Bonnie.

Sage took it from my hand and handed it to Bonnie.  "Bring it back later please.  It'll ruin our breakfast."

I looked at Sage with a grin, "That's kinda why she brought it out now.  I don't indulge on such things but when I do it's before."

Sage smiled brightly at Bonnie, "Please?"

"You don't have to bring it back at all, Bonnie."  I said.  I didn't need ice-cream.

Sage looked at me with a wide grin, "Of course she does.  Just not for breakfast."

I nodded to Bonnie, "You heard the man."

She raised an eyebrow behind Sage's back questioning the situation I only smiled back.  Sage turned to his own plate and pressed his leg against mine and picked up his fork with his left hand and his right fell to my knee and he squeezed, "Eat."

I winked at Bonnie and did as he asked.  I grinned at Sage, "It's better that we sat on this side, anyway."  If we'd sat on the other side, we'd be bumping elbows as we ate.  Now we could hold hands while we ate, and that's what we did as I slide my hand between his hand and my leg and curled my long fingers around his.  

Sage grinned down and looked at the color on my nails. "You always match them?"

I shook my head.  "No, I'm still sporting the usual club look.  Nails change as they chip."

Sage set his fork down and pointed to a chipped spot on my index finger, "Like that one?"

I nodded, "Yeah.  Now it's going to drive me crazy.  Thanks."  I stuck my tongue out at him.

"Don't do that."  Sage warned with a smile.

"Why not?"  I asked playfully.

"You might not get it back."  He teased as he popped a forkful of scrambled eggs and bacon into his mouth.

I grinned at Sage.  "That might not be so bad."

It stabbed the steak I had already cut on my plate and pulled my attention back to my food.  "Eat."

"All right, all right."  

We ate in relative silence, holding hands and our legs pressed against each other in the booth.  Several people had come and gone in the time we ate our meal.  

When Bonnie placed the check and another chocolate milk shake on the table I reached for the check and Sage moved faster than I had expected and was pulling it from underneath my hand and handing Bonnie cash.  "I got it.  I asked you here remember.  No macho games.  Whoever asks pays."

"What if we don't ask, like it's a agreed upon stop because we were hungry?"  I asked playfully as I pulled my hand back.

Sage laughed.  "Always plan everything?"

I shrugged. "Not everything.  I'm not good with surprises honestly."

"I could tell you I would rather always pay.  Would that bother you?"  Sage asked with a smile.  I wasn't sure if he was being serious or if this was some test.

"No.  It wouldn't bother me.  But it makes me wonder how much more you'd want to control."  Was Sage one of those men who had to be in control? Did he need someone who would obey everything?  

The look on Sage's face was a little worrisome.  His eyes were warring with something inside.  I put my hand on his knee and smiled.  "I can give you control when we are together.  I don't need to be alpha male."

Sage smiled back, but it didn't reach his eyes.  "You are already an alpha."  He stood up and offered his hand.  "I want you to meet someone."

I took his hand, and we walked out of the diner with a wave to Bonnie.  It was a short walk to the train station and we went two stops down before switching trains and heading into another part of town.  

Everyone knew the City was broken up into territories.  What the humans didn't know is that it had even more lines they didn't know about.  The Venatori controlled most of both the Upper East and West sides and all of Midtown. Vampires controlled all of Harlem, Manhattan Valley and Carnegie Hill. And the wolves controlled Hell's Kitchen and Turtle Bay, and everything south of Midtown.

Sage got off the train in the heart of Hell's Kitchen.  We were in wolf territory.  I pulled the hood of my sweat shirt up as I followed Sage.  He held my hand like it was no big deal.  He thought nothing was wrong, I hoped that the wolves didn't think I was here out of context.  It had been many years since I'd come into Hell's Kitchen on anything but Venatori business.  

The buildings looked familiar.  Sage started into one of the four story apartment buildings I knew were wolf territory and I pulled my hand from Sage's grasp.  "Why are we going in there?"

Sage looked at me with pleading eyes.  "Please.  No one will hurt you.  I promise."

I took a deep breath and took Sage's hand he had continued to hold out "Sage, what are you getting me into?"

"Nothing.  I promise.  It's not going to start a war."

"So you know where I am?"  I was confused even more now.

"Yes.  Please.  Nox, come with me."  I sighed and resigned myself to follow Sage.  I pulled my hoodie around me tighter like I felt cold, but I wasn't cold from the air.  It was old memories.  I could feel the wolf energy prickling my skin.  It wasn't safe for me here.

Sage knocked on a door and pulled me against him and took my hood down.  "It's okay.  I promise."

I heard rustling on the other side of the door and then the door unlatched and a woman answered.  She was wearing a small apron and covered in flour.  "Sage.  Darling, what a surprise."

"Mama Rose, this is my friend Nox."

I nodded to her and bowed my head.  I could feel the power of the pack behind her.  She spoke, "Come on in boys."

She moved into the house and towards the kitchen and I followed Sage through the apartment after closing the door behind us.  I saw pictures of the family on the hallway wall as we passed them.  I stopped when I saw a familiar face and swallowed hard.  Sage was looking at me when I turned.  "You okay?"

I nodded.  "Yeah.  Things make sense now.  Or are starting to."

Sage smiled and headed into the living room.  The TV was on and a man was sitting on the couch.  I stopped in the doorway and stared at the large Hispanic man watching television.  "Adrian."  I whispered.

I looked at Sage, "Why have you brought me to your alpha?  He is your alpha right?"

Sage nodded.  "I'm not a werewolf if that's what you are afraid of."

I frowned.  "I knew that from the get-go.  But I didn't know you were the foster son of Danny Morgan.  When did they bring you in?"

Sage sat down on the floor facing Adrian.  "When I was adopted by the Morgan's."

"You knew who I was the first time we met?"  I asked.  "When I was with your friend, Alice?"

Sage nodded.  "I knew of you, yes.  You are kinda a legend here.  Danny works with you.  Our alpha helped you, I know that much."

"I paid Adrian to help me."  I qualified.  "It wasn't because he was a wolf."

"I know.  You've been sharing all these big things with me.  This is all I have left.  And your questions made me think you needed to know."  Sage frowned.

"You are omega?"  I asked.

But Sage didn't have time to answer, Adrian interrupted him. "No.  He's not.  He's under pack protection until he turns, or taken as someone's mate."

"He can't turn. Adrian, he's a path."

Adrian smiled.  "I know.  He doesn't. We'd have already turned him, he's well past the age."

There was one nagging question in my mind and I had to ask it, "Did you?  with him?"  Adrian was a psychologist by professional standards, but he was more of a sex therapist than any traditional one.  I had paid him to teach me not to be a victim.  It wasn't about the sex, but it was still the same type training he did with some of his clients.  It was how he met his wife.  They ran the business together and shared in the kinkier side of it.  Adrian was a dominant male, and he'd been my top for many years.  Until I grew too powerful he said.

Adrian was smiling while he waited for my brain to refocus on him.  He was used to my thought process even after the years of absence.  He shook his head.  "No."

"Then why does he speak to me the way he does?"  I asked. 

Adrian's grin grew wider.  "I advised him how to catch you."

"Catch me?"  I sounded as confused as I was.

"He came to me a few weeks after you first met him in Aspect.  When you went off with the girl.  He said he'd met you in person.  I saw how he spoke about you.  I gave him a few pointers on how to act around you and treat you if he truly wanted to capture your attention."

I knelt down in front of Sage who had been picking at the carpet he sat on.  "So you don't really want the control you were asking for? You were playing me?"

Sage looked up and I could see the tears in his eyes and I wanted to dry them.  I didn't want to see him sad.  I had to look down at the floor.  He put two fingers under my chin and made me look at him.  "I liked how you reacted to me, how you'd smile and go with what I said.  When I gave you the card and took ..."  Sage blushed but I wouldn't make him say it here, if we'd been alone I might have.  "I didn't think you'd call me because I'd been so forward.  Then I got the text you didn't send me.  But you called me afterwards.  I like the power.  But you are an alpha, I feel it.  I couldn't take control that was yours to have.  The pack would kill me for overstepping."

I smiled at Sage.  "They will have to go through me to do that."  I turned around and sat down next to Sage and put my hand on his leg and looked up at Adrian who was smiling.  

He chuckled and called out, "Rosella, you have raised the pup well.  But I think he out grows us."

Rosella came out with a plate of freshly baked cookies and placed them on the coffee table in front of Adrian.  "He will always be my pup and always welcome here."  She gave Adrian a hard stare.

"He will always be welcome in the pack.  But I think his standing will change."

Sage got up on his knees and crawled to Adrian, "I can't get any lower."

Adrian put his hand on Sage's head, "Not lower, little one."

Sage looked up at Adrian, "What do you mean?"

Adrian just smiled.  "I'm sure we will all see."

Adrian grabbed a cookie and stood up.  "Nox.  It's been a pleasure.  Take care of my pup.  Or should he be the one taking care of you?"

I stood up and offered my hand to Adrian.  "I think we need to take care of each other, Adrian."

He took a bite of the cookie with a smile.  When he finished, he yelled, "Excellent cookies, Rosella."  He turned back to me, "And excellent answer."

Adrian left the room and the house with little more than a fond farewell to Sage's foster mother.  Sage still sat on the floor on his hands and knees looking at the floor.  I sat down on the couch and looked down at his bowed head, "You don't have to stay that way, he's gone."

"He wasn't the only alpha in the room."

I laughed.  "I'm not going to order you around. I am not pack.  You do not need to heed in any terms."

Sage looked up and shook his head. "You are pack.  I feel it."  Sage sat back on his heels and put his hand against his heart, "I feel it where I feel the rest of the pack.  Adrian considers you pack.  You are pack."

I sighed.  "Fine.  We'll do this proper then.  I yield my power to you and only you Sage Morgan. I am yours to command."

There was a gasp from the kitchen from Mrs. Morgan as she eavesdropped on our conversation.  But it was Sage who was looking at me with wide sapphire blue eyes, "Do you know what you did?"

I nodded. "Yes.  I'm not pack so I didn't feel whatever power shift you did, but I feel it's different in the room now."

Sage shook his head, "You are lower than me now?  Why did you do that?"

"I am lower than you, but I didn't sink to the bottom.  I raised you above me.  You command my power in the pack.  Whatever that means since I'm not pack.  I did it because you liked the way it felt to take charge of me.  No one can confront you now about being controlling with me because I gave you my power to control."  

I took a breath and continued, "You could make a move with that power.  If you do and we end this, you would be in a terrible situation.  Unless you kept the power, and I then had no choice but to do as you asked with in pack laws.  But I'm Venatori.  My rules out weight your rules by the Clandestine Providence.  I can't do my job if you had complete control of my abilities."

"Why though?  We aren't even dating." Sage asked.

I smiled, and I leaned my forehead against his and whispered, "I like when you tell me what to do. I need you to."

Sage grinned at me, "So even if I hadn't brought you here you would have given the power to me?"

I sighed, "Not all of it.  Even Adrian will tell you, I am not a perfect submissive.  But I like when decisions are taken from me.  So not having to worry about who is paying is a relief.  My schedule is part of my coping mechanism to get through the anxiety of my nightmares and the daily changes of adult life.  The less I worry about the better I feel, and the more time I can feel safe."

Sage asked, "You have you all figured out don't you?"

I shook my head.  "No, Sage I don't.  I learn things everyday."

He grinned.  "What did you learn today?"

"So far," I smiled, "I've learned I need to trust you."  

Sage looked confused, "You don't trust me?"

I shook my head.  "I trust you.  I don't want to trust you.  I need to trust you.  Like I need to breathe."  I emphasized want and need to make my point.

Sage smiled and took my hand, "Let me show my childhood bedroom."  We stood, and I followed Sage deeper into the apartment he grew up in.  This was not what I expected on my birthday.
