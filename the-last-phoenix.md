# Aspect

New York City in the early summer was warm but the air around our small little group was nice with a small bite of chill to it.  Little lines formed around Mia's mouth as she frowned at me.  "Nox, stop showing off."

I gave my best friend's wife a wide toothy grin.  "I'm not.  It's fucking hot out here."

"It's only June.  What's July and August gonna be like?" Jace complained.  "Just be thankful he'll be around to make our weather change.  Outdoor air conditioning."  Mia's arm was a blur of speed as she slugged her husband with a smile.  "Ow!" Jace said rubbing his arms and grinning like a fool.  

Jace swept Mia in tight against his body and kissed her.  I turned around and surveyed the line - giving them at least a modicum of privacy.  I could have given them complete privacy, but throwing up a veil just to hide what every other couple was doing as we stood in line at Club Aspect felt pointless.

It was my birthday weekend.  Jace and I had been going to this club the Friday before my birthday every year since we turned 16.  I could have walked up to the bouncer, flashed him my drivers license and flirted with him to get in to the club.  It was an Aspect tradition.  The bouncers usually only did it for girls, but the bouncer on the door tonight was just as into men flirting with him as the girls.  Or at least he used to be, in my younger years it was exactly what I did. 

But now I wasn't sneaking into Club Aspect against Dae'lin and Dorian's wishes; I was not eager to get inside the club.  Outside was quieter and we could talk.  It's funny how growing up makes being able to talk one of the defining points of any outing.  But we were here to celebrate my birth.  It was a tradition. 

Fingers entwined between my long fingers and I turned to see Mia.  She reached up and ran her fingers through my chocolate brown hair with the fringe dyed sapphire blue.  The hair color matched my nail polish and my shirt.  She smiled up at me with her big brown eyes.  I was happy for Jace, he settled down with the love of his life.  They dated each other on and off for so many years it felt funny to have them together for so long.  But they were happily married with kid number one.  They were talking about kid number two.  

Jace was all for it, but he came from a large family.  Mia on the other hand was like most Venatori - one sibling and raised inside of the Apex Unlimited building by the community.  

I'd been getting hounded for the past few months, my deadline for procreation was approaching.  The Venatori unlike humans are a small contained race.  We don't limit procreation but we require it, and after graduation you were given 5 years to create a progeny of your own devices.  If you failed to follow through on it during those 5 years, they would hound you and make you look for a partner that fifth year.  That's where I was.  

Dr. Hillary Silas had been sending me emails and texts.  She stalked my every move trying to get me to decide.  The fact that I was half human had a big impact on the women who would sleep with me to make a child.  However, being the most powerful Cesari offset that for some, but not for others.  I only had to choose a girl, like it was that simple.  I'd been avoiding it, and I was more than happy to ignore it tonight. 

Mia put her hand around my neck which meant she had to stand on her tip toes and pulled me down to her level.  "You so need a drink."

I grinned at her.  "I just need to get lost in the music with some random girl or guy and I'll be good. No need to drown in alcohol when the music will do the same thing."  Dancing was one of the few things that calmed my anxieties.  Dae'lin didn't sanction it, she told me it was a foolish endeavor when I was growing up.  But both Dorian and Margo encouraged it.  They didn't encourage my sneaking out to learn, nor my sneaking out to go to clubs to dance, but they encouraged the natural release - it was better than drinking or drugs. 

Mia tugged on my hand and laughed.  "Well that's good birthday-boy cause we are up."

Jace leaned against the red velvet rope that separated us from the entrance.  He winked at the bouncer and put his wide hand on the bouncers bicep and smiled.   He laid on the southern charm including that southern accent he kept hidden most of the time.  "Ain't that sexy."  He squeezed the man's arm, but he shook Jace off with ease.  

Mia laughed and dropped my hand to pull her husband away from the bouncer. "Don't mind him, he's not drunk enough yet to be smooth."

Jace frowned.  "Hey.  I'm smooth."  My best friend turned with his blue eyes and his disheveled blond hair and a playful grin then said, "Ain't I Nox.  I'm smooth."

Mia rolled her eyes. "Let him sweet talk the bouncer, Jace, you suck at it."

"We are next.  Why do I need to sweet talk anyone?"  I complained.  I didn't see the point of flirting with the bouncer. 

Mia goaded me, "Oh, come on Nox.  Show us how you do it."

I sighed but relented.  With a wide smile and bright eyes I held my drivers license between two fingers and I laid the two painted fingers against the man's arm.  Unlike Jace, I would only do the barest amount of touching to a man with questionable strength.  I wasn't super strong like Jace, this man had arms the size of my legs and he could break me in half like a twig if he so wanted.  

I knew my eyelashes were a defining feature - or so many girls informed me with 'I wish I had your eyelashes'.  And the eyeliner I wore around my eyes only made that more apparent.  The small gesture had brought the bouncer's attention with ease. There was no need to bat pretty eyelashes when you could just smile with your eyes. 

I leaned across the red velvet rope and pressed my chest against his arm.  If I'd been a girl, it would have worked better, but it was the closeness I wanted as I whispered into his ear.  "It's my birthday.  Mind if you let us on in now, Duckling?"   

The big black bouncer chuckled and took my drivers license from my hand with a smile.  "It's not till Sunday."  Jace was reaching into his pocket for his wallet, a big tip might let us in.  But it wasn't part of the game to get in.  I put my hand on his arm to ask him to wait.  The bouncer was watching me with coal black eyes.

"What would let you let us in early?" I asked with a sideways grin.  I knew the answer already. 

The man on the other side of the rope said, "You kiss your friends here and given the crowd a little show.  I'll let you in."

Mia and Jace both laughed.  "Seriously, that's all?" 

The man must have thought that I wouldn't go through with it because he laughed with them. "You know the rules."  And we did.  I'd seen it happen.  A guy tries to flirt with the male bouncer to get in early and when the request for them to kiss another man came they'd be like all 'oh I don't do that'.  I wasn't most guys, I did.  

I grinned at him and I offered Mia my hand first and she took it with grace.  Her skin was soft against my fingers and I pulled her close to kiss her deeply.  It wasn't much of a show - but he said my friends here, which included Mia. 

The bouncer laughed, "That wasn't what I meant."

I broke the kiss with Mia and she was looking up at me with those big brown eyes breathless.  We'd never dated, but we had slept together - with Jace, but still we'd done so much more than kiss before, but we hadn't since before they had gotten married.  I grinned.  "I know.  I'm just getting started."

Jace made a game of it. He hid behind Mia but she helped me as I grabbed his grey t-shirt and pulled him against me.  He came with the gentle tug - he had wanted me to catch him.  His blue eyes were sparkling with desire.  Jason and I had never had sex.  We'd been in the same bed with girls and guys.  We'd touched each other and even spent the night alone together in the same bed.  But we'd never done more than what I was about to do right now.  I licked my lips and the sparkle in Jace's eyes grew into a dark lust filled look. 

I closed the gap between our lips and we kissed.  The surrounding crowd cheered but my mind was on the man before me.  The way his lips felt against mine.  The taste of dinner lingering on his tongue as they danced inside our mouths.  I tried to break away but Jace kept me close deepening the kiss.  My heart raced and my breath was quickening.  Jace knew how I liked it.  

He broke the kiss and pressed his forehead against mine.  "Happy Birthday, bro."

I gave Jace a peck on the lips and smiled at my best friend.  "Thanks."

The bouncer behind us cleared his throat. "I'm feeling left out after a kiss like that."

I laughed and winked at Jace before I turned around and laid a kiss deep on the big black man's lips.  He gasped and stiffened as I did it but he relaxed into it and then I felt a hand along my waist line pulling me closer.  When the kiss broke he laughed.  "I will remember you next time."

I whispered into his ear as I walked past the now removed red velvet rope.  "It helps when you like boys."

He laughed hard as we walked through.  I handed the man a twenty.  "Been a pleasure."  I dropped my arm in front of me and I bowed with a flourish.  And turned on my heel and went into the club.  The music grew louder and Mia pulled me down close so she could whisper in my ear.  "We'll catch up with you in an hour.  See what your plans are."

I laughed into her ear and placed a tender kiss on her cheek, "I'm going home with you and Jace tonight.  When you guys are ready to go just let me know."

She stopped and looked up at me with confusion and Jace leaned down and whispered something in his wife's ear. She smiled and nodded and then whispered in my ear.  "Okay, we'll find you when we are ready to go home.  Don't do anything we wouldn't do."  Mia giggled as Jace dragged her off on to the dance floor.  I watched my best friend and his wife disappear into the mass of bodies moving to the beat of the music.

ï»¿I made my way to the bar on the other side of the room.  I would not get drunk, but I wanted a beer none-the-less.  However, I never made it across the room before a hand was grabbing my arm and pulling me into the hallway that lead to the bathrooms.  "Whoa, whoa, I don't even know you."  

The small blonde looked up at me with a frown of disgust etched into her face.  "What?"  She looked down the hall to the line of women coming out of one door and paled. I laughed.  She spluttered, "No.  Not."  She stamped her foot into the ground and glared up at me with green eyes that were neither pretty nor one of those disgusting colors; they were just green.  She could use a little makeup if you asked me. 

There must have been a smirk on my face.  "Wipe that smile off your face.  This isn't a game, Nox."

"You know my name.  I think it only benefits us both if I know yours."  I grinned at her with evil in my eyes.  "Otherwise what name am I going to scream out when I come?"

The color of her face turned to the color of a beet.  She wasn't red - more like purple with rage.  "I am Dr. Hillary Silas.  I am..."

"What the fuck lady, are you following me?  I'm out having a good time and you are here hounding me.  Can't this wait.  Make a damn appointment like everyone else."

"Mr. SÃ©tanta I have been trying.  You won't return my calls."  She was furious.

"My name is Nox."  I hated being called Mr. SÃ©tanta, it was just a reminder that my mother was a bitch.  "My calendar is public for a reason. Ms. Silas."

"Dr. Silas."

I guffawed.  "Dr. Silas.  See where I'm busy.  If you make an appointment, I'll be there.  I'm leaving now."  I turned to walk away, but she grabbed my arm again.

"Mr.... Nox.  I'm here now let's talk."

"Look, lady.  I'm here to drink and dance, so unless you want to do either of them leave me alone."  I yanked my arm free of her tight grasp.  Surprise lit my face.  I hadn't expected it to be so easy to stalk off to the bar.  But I felt her following me.

There were plenty of girls at the bar, but that wouldn't scare the lady away.  But there was one guy standing there alone.  He had bright blue eyes. I recognized them from somewhere.  But I couldn't place him this far away.  He was leaning against the bar watching the dancers.  He'd work - hopefully.

The blue-eyed man was drinking a Sam Adams, and I grinned.  I walked up beside him and slipped into the small space between him and another man at the bar and leaned against it waving at the bar tender.  When she came by with a sweet smile and pink hair I said, "I'll have what he's having."  I pointed at the blue-eyed man and said it loud enough for both he and the bartender to hear. 

I could feel the piercing green eyes of my stalker as the blue-eyed man turned to look at me with a grin.  I smiled at him and I saw the deeper blue - the sapphire blue eyes that matched my signature color today.  He grinned at me in return.  I knew his face.  I don't know why, but I did.  He shifted so that his attention was on me, his body was long and lean and I made it obvious I was checking him out.  I would love to see that body naked.

Dr. Hillary Silas was watching me check the man out and when I leaned against him a little while I waited for my beer to arrive she stomped her foot and left with a loud huff.  I grinned and turned my attention back to the pretty man before me.  "Hey, Duckling."

My blue-eyed friend laughed and handed me my beer.  "Hi," he said with a grin. 

I took a long swig of my beer, never breaking eye contact with those great blue eyes of his.  

I leaned over and took a deep breath.  He smelled clean with a hint of lavender. I hummed softly into his ear before speaking.  "Want to dance?"

He turned against my cheek and chuckled, "First, tell me what that was about."

I pulled away and looked at him.  "You mean her deal?"

He nodded, and I shrugged in return, "She's stalking me.  I told her to make an appointment."

He grinned at me with a mischievous glint in his eyes.  "She won't contact your pimp huh?"

I laughed at him but I wondered how much he knew about me to make such a comment.  "Bitch don't know the rules."  He laughed, and I bit my bottom lip as I watched the mirth in his face and the light in his eyes.  Such beautiful eyes.  "Dance with me?"  I said a little too breathless for me taste, but he nodded and his smile grew wider and stayed on his face as we walked to the dance floor. 

The music got louder on the floor, it was darker and his eyes turned into deep pools of black.  He was taller than me by a few inches - so rare for me to have to look up even those short few inches.  It was refreshing.  The beat thrummed through our bodies as I pulled him against me and we moved with the throng of people.  It looked chaotic from the outside, but from the inside it was a perfect pattern.  One couple would move this way, and another would take their place.  The singles would mingle through the dance floor following the beat, brushing their bodies against another single or a part of a couple.  

A small brunette curled up against my blue-eyed friend and he turned to face her, his back side pushed against my front.  I wrapped my hand around the front of his stomach to move with him as he danced with the girl in front of him.  She smiled and moved off to the next man dancing to our left.  But we didn't move.  His hand reached up behind me and he leaned his head back against me as we moved around the dance floor. 

I buried my face in the crook of his neck and breathed in his clean scent.  My heart was racing both from the exertion of dancing and from the excitement building inside of me.  I hadn't come in to the club with the thought of getting laid, but here was this beautiful man before me, making me want him the more we danced. 

I lost track of the time, of how many songs we had danced too.  I got lost in him and he was more than willing to dance his night away with me.  We'd had a few women come up behind both of us during our dancing, none stayed long when they noticed we were into each other more than her.  A blond with purple tips wrapped her arms around my blue-eyed friend's neck and he leaned down to let her speak in his ear.  His friend.  I remembered her too but from where I didn't know. 

She left through the throng of people and he wrapped his arms around my neck and pressed his body against me.  His hands trailed down my back, and I froze with fear as his fingers brushed against the silky blue shirt that matched his eyes. Until he found the to waist of my jeans.  He played with the belt loops before pulling me closer with his hands on my ass.  He grinned as he felt the foil packs in my back pocket.  

One hand left my ass, and I didn't know where he was moving it to, caught up in the motion of his face dipping into the crook of my neck and his lips brushing feather light touches against the tight skin of my collar bone.  I lost all breath and bit back a moan that tried to escape and betray my cool exterior.  He was unraveling me with ease.

He pulled away and held a crumpled card between two fingers making sure I saw it. I followed his movements until his hand was behind me and slipping it into my back pocket.  He grinned. Those blue eyes sparkling at me as he held up the two foil packs that had been in my back pocket.  He leaned closer and whispered.  "I'll take these.  Call me."  I stood in stunned silenced awed by his game.  My blue-eyed tormentor held the packs between two fingers and slipped them into his own back pocket with a mischievous grin.  He left me standing there alone watching him walk away, but he turned around with a smile and shouted, "Call me," before he slipped through the crowd and disappeared with his purple haired friend. 

With a sigh I left the dance floor myself and headed for the bar.  I couldn't help but look for the mysterious blue-eyed man who played me better than I had played him.  He left me wanting more.  I reached into my back pocket and pulled out his card.  It read.  "Sage Morgan. Security Consultant"  Below his name listed his contact information, email and phone number included.  

I tucked the crumpled card back into my pocket when Mia found me and pulled the stiff paper from my pocket with a grin and turned on her heel and headed off the dance floor to find Jace.  He was standing near the bar sipping at a beer holding two others by the necks in his free hand.

Mia cozied up next to him, wrapping her hand around his waist and holding the crumbled business card up for him to read.  I snatched the card from her fingers and she giggled at me.  "You never keep their numbers."

I grinned at her.  "He took something of mine."  I tucked the number back into my back pocket.  I wouldn't ever call him, but throwing it away after he made such a big effort to leave me wanting him made me keep it.

Jace handed me a beer.  "Drink up, we need to get home.  Babysitter called.  Naya's running a fever."

Mia rolled her eyes.  "She's only teething, but Jace has gone all panicked father so we have to go."

I took a swallow of the beer and set it down.  "We can go anytime."

Jace laughed, "What you aren't going to hook up first?"

"Do I always hook up?" I asked.  Both my friends nodded their heads with great big gestures. "I do not."

"You do too." They said in unison, looking at each other with a grin afterwards. 

I sighed with a grin as I patted my back pocket.  "Seems my mysterious blue-eyed boy took my protection with him."

Jace busted out laughing.  The guys standing next to us gave us that look and moved a little further away which made Jace laugh even harder.  "Don't look at me bro, I don't carry anymore."

"I'm good."  I took his beer from him and set it down next to mine and Mia followed.  "We can go - honest."



# Family Life

We took the subway to Brooklyn.  Jason had gone to school with me since we were five years old, but his family was old school Southern.  They owned a piece of land down home that provided fresh food to the Apex Unlimited compound and their other subsidiary businesses.  They weren't farmers who struggled - they were rich and well off and they had a large family and tons of employees.  

He went home every holiday we had off and he drug me with him occasionally.  The first time he'd asked me, we weren't even friends - his parents made him.  

Mrs. Hill was helping Jace pack the last of his things for winter break.  And she asked, "You going anywhere for the holiday's Nox?"

I shook my head no.  "No, ma'am."

Jason said in sing song, "He doesn't have a family," making fun of me.

Mrs. Hill gasped. "No family?  Really?"

I only shrugged.  I didn't care.  I was five, and I was still hoping my mother would decide I could come home, but she'd not responded to any of Dorian's queries and I stayed at the Academy while everyone else was home with their folks, even if their folks lived in the same building they would be upstairs with them.  But not me.  I had no family.  Mrs. Hill took pity on me.  "Pack your things then, Nox.  You are coming home with us."

Jason groaned.  But I knew better than to disobey.  Obedience had been beaten into me since my first days there. 

I went home with Jace and his family.  At first Jace and I hated each other, we only hung out because his mother would mention it otherwise.  I was more than happy to sit with my nose in a book or working on my control of the elements.  But she insisted I have fun with Jace.  And after awhile we became good friends.  It took time away from other boys to find out we had a lot in common, and that we liked each other. 

But Jace was a family guy.  He wanted the whole deal - wife, kids, house and a white picket fence.  And he had all of that in Brooklyn including the white picket fence and an in-ground swimming pool.  Naya, their 9-month-old daughter, would be the highlight of my stay with them.  I hadn't seen her since her birth.  Just so busy that I hadn't got time to spend time with her or them. 

So for my birthday they promised to take me out, if I promised to come home with them and cook breakfast on top of it.  The whole family package except it wasn't my family.  One day we'd be able to do both our families together, but that required me to settle down or at least find a girl willing to make babies with me.  I'd be happy even as a single parent, I don't know if I could handle the stress alone, but I have help. 

Once we were in Brooklyn, Jace drove his black SUV from the train station to their house.  They lived in a tight neighborhood with a bunch of two story brownstones.  A white picket fence surrounded his yard and was much larger than most houses in the neighborhood.  He'd been smart and bought two properties and ripped them both down to build what he wanted including the in ground pool in their back yard.  It looked out place in this Brooklyn neighborhood, but the Hill's were a popular family with all their weekend pool parties in the summer. 

Mia unlocked the door and a short brunette stepped out of the kitchen carrying a small fussing bundle with brown hair sticking up out of the blanket.  "Hey, sweet thang.  I missed you," I said as  I took the baby from their babysitter without asking. She squawked at me.  "Hey!  What the hell..."

Mia laughed.  "It's okay.  Lynn this is Nox, he's Naya's godfather."  Which was as close as the human terms came to what I was to Naya, we called it pareses.  If anything happened to Jace and Mia, I would become their children's guardian but it was much more than that and hard to explain.

The little teenager stared at me as I lifted Naya above my head and the baby giggled. "Hey, baby."  I danced around their living room with the sweet little baby.  I could feel the eyes of the teenager girl on me.  When I looked up, I grinned at her and Mia frowned while she whisked her off to the front door.  

Jace laughed.  "You'll flirt with anyone."

I grinned down at Naya cradled down in my arms, "I only got eyes for you, baby."

Mia came back in.  "That's not what you said earlier.  Your blue-eyed mystery boy?"  Mia giggled behind her hand. 

I sat down on their faux leather couch with Naya in my arms.  "Yes, Naya.  There was this beautiful man with bright sapphire blue eyes."  I kissed her cheek and nuzzled my nose against her and she cooed back at me.  "He gave me his number and I might actually call him."  I picked her up over my head and leaned back against the couch.  She giggled.  "What do you think of that?"

Mia sat down next to me. "I think, if you don't mind me saying. I think you should call him.  He was cute."

I nodded.  "He was."

Mia smiled at me cuddling with her daughter.  "You will be such a great dad.  Naya loves you so much."

"I love her so much." My voice dropped into that baby talk voice.  "I can't wait to have my own."

"I saw Dr. Silas bothering you.  She your progeny agent?"

"I nodded.  Yeah she apparently knows nothing about me.  Hasn't ready any of my files or spoken to anyone who knows me.  We could have talked months earlier if she'd just scheduled an appointment like everyone else."

"Nox, would you like me to schedule that appointment for you?"  Mia put her hand on my knee.  "I will let her know when I see her in the morning."

"Why the hell not."  I said with a sigh, I didn't want to talk about how ineligible I was or the fact I liked men or even I was half human, but it was all going to be a factor in everything this lady wanted.  My obligation to have children is only a chore because I'm on a timeline.  Being Venatori isn't always a good thing. 

Jace stood in front of me holding his arms out as if I would give him his child.  I looked up at him with a grim smile and he pouted.  "Aw, come on man.  She has to go to bed.  Don't steal my one thing from me."

"Your one thing?  You mean this is the only time you help Mia out?"

Jace stammered, "Well, uh. No, but dude this is my baby time.  Mine!"

I handed the small bundle of joy over to her father.  "Fine.  I guess I don't want to change diapers just yet."  I stuck my tongue out at him as he did the same.  Yes, we were childish, and we both loved it.  

Mia giggled as she got up.  "I'm going to grab a shower.  You go swim and join us in the big bed Nox.  We already discussed it.  You sleep better when someone's with you and you've not had anyone with you in a while.  Call it a birthday gift, if you want, but you are staying in our bed tonight."

"Yes ma'am."  I agreed reluctantly, which meant that Jace and Mia would sacrifice their comfort for mine tonight.  Not what I came out here for but I wouldn't argue with my hostess as she was getting ready for bed.

I stood up from the couch to do my thing.  I changed into swim trunks in the small golden half bath off the living room.  I stared at my self in the small mirror above the sink and sighed.  Why did I do this if I wanted to be a serious candidate for fatherhood?  Why did I still act the child?  Honestly, I did what I did because I'd always done it.  I didn't know how to be anything more than what I am.  And while I like to spend time alone in the comfort of my home or my family's home, because that is what Jace's family was. I still enjoyed being the guy everyone else knew me as.  They say fake it till you make it.  I think I made it.  I'm not sure that's a good thing or a bad thing, but I like who I am, and there is no doctor in the world who will change that. 

I pushed away from the sink after removing the eyeliner now instead of later and I headed for the kitchen.  The house was quiet and the moment I opened the sliding glass doors to the back yard in the kitchen I could hear the busyness of Brooklyn at night.  It was still scorching out, but I was going swimming so it didn't matter.  The ground was rough against the soles of my feet but the water was refreshing. 

I waded into the pool and then swam laps across the length of it.  It wasn't a huge pool, and it was only a few strokes long, but it was the perfect full body work out.  It was the best feeling in the world focusing on one thing - the only thing that mattered in that moment was making each movement count.  Pushing through the pain as I grew tired, I finished the allotted number of laps across the pool.  

By the time I finished an hour had passed and my arms and legs both felt like jelly.  I floated on my back staring up at the stars you could barely see with the city lights.  I knew there were more up there.  I'd see more in my life time.  It was one of few memories I had of my mother that were good.  

We sat outside our cabin high in the Rocky mountains laying on a large rock staring up at the stars.  I was almost five then, we'd sit looking for shapes in the stars like we did with the clouds in the daytime sky.  My mom tried to show me the big dipper, and other real constellations but I couldn't see what she saw.  So we made up our own.  It was a good memory, and I pushed it away as I climbed out of the pool.  My mother had hated me in the end, the memory was not worth remembering.

I grabbed my towel and dried off as I walked into the house.  Everything was dark, the light were all out, Mia and Jace had gone to bed while I swam.  I smiled as I pulled a dry pair of boxers and a t-shirt from my bag of clothes Jace always kept around.  I could have a permanent room here if I wanted one, but I didn't want to intrude.  And besides they needed both rooms if they would have two kids in the future. 

It wasn't the first time I'd slept on the couch, and it wouldn't be the last.  It was almost my second home, and it was better than sleeping on the ground.  There were pillows and blankets laying on the edge of the couch like Mia knew I wouldn't come to bed. I hope she understood. 

As I lay staring at the ceiling willing myself to sleep I knew the nightmares would come the moment I closed my eyes.  It was a chore just to sleep to put myself at the mercy of my mind.  But the body required sleep, so I forced my eyes closed and I began the soft rhythmic breathing I used for yoga.  As my breathing and heart rate slowed, I counted - focusing on nothing but breathing and the numbers.  It took effort to not let your mind wander in the depths of the darkness.  The darkness swept me away into the expanse of my own mind.

The darkness gave way to images - images that were always darker than the surrounding blackness. How it was possible I donât know, but it was suffocating and the red glowing eyes came as they did every night for as long as I could remember. They came alone in the silence of the darkness wielding whips made of fire, jagged earth, razor-sharp air, the only element missing was water. Water didnât make a good whip it was too soothing, too cooling. No, instead the ground find with it. My shoes and socks were soaking wet. The water wicked up my jeans making them damp and heavy across my hips.

Fog rolled in and the glowing red eyes made everything this hazy red color. The glow from the fire whips flickered against the fog and I bit back the fear that came when the fog did clouding my view of the darkness - of my nightmare.

I yelped the first time Iâd felt the razor sharp sting of the whips applied to my skin. I no longer made a sound as the first blow landed across the center of my back. I bit back the pain and the scream. But making a sound only made it worse. I could feel the blood dripping down my back as the elemental tentacles of my nightmare rained down along my back. One word sounded over and over again as each blow landed, âSpark.â

The eyes grew closer. As they did every night. The closer they got the more fear rose, the harder each blow. The shorter the time between blows until the eyes were in front of me and I could almost make out the face inside the hood with the glowing red eyes, but as with every night it yelled, âSpark.â

My eyes flew open. My heart was racing, and I tumbled to the floor unable to move in the limited space of the couch cushions. The thump was loud, and I hoped I woke no one up as I lay on my back staring up at the ceiling. I didnât bother checking the time, it was around 4am. It was always around 4am. My phone sitting on the coffee table started its chirping - 4am alarm. I hadnât needed it in ages. My self-conscious woke up at 4am. My day would start regardless at 4am.

I crawled to the center of Jaceâs living room and crossed my legs and sat down to begin my morning yoga practice. My arms and legs were still sore from swimming last night. It was a good feeling to have as I stretched into the first pose.

I hadnât been holding it more than 15 seconds when I heard a soft chuckle coming from behind me. I canât imagine it was anyone other than Mia - Jace didnât giggle.

I turned around into the next pose and smiled up at Mia. She was wearing a flowery bathrobe and fuzzy slippers. âHmmm?â I said as I stretched into the next pose.

Mia sat down on the couch, âI was just admiring the view.â

I grinned at her as I continued my workout. We sat in silence for the rest of the poses. 30 minutes with Jaceâs wife watching me. If it had been any other girl Iâd have sat down next to her and tried to make out. But she was my best friendâs wife, and I didnât do married.

âI donât know what everyoneâs problem with you is. The girls at work all grin and giggle like school girls when they see you walk past. They donât know you, but when I suggest they ask you out they shake their heads. They say, âNo, No, heâs such a playerâ.â Mia sighed. âAll these women will miss out on you if you are seriously thinking about calling this guy back.â Mia held up the card my mysterious blue-eyed man had given me. âI know men have always been your thing. But you canât start a family with another man.â

I sat down next to Mia and plucked the card from her fingers and smiled at her. âWhy canât I? My father isnât married. Heâs got 5 kids plus me. I donât need to be married to some women to have a family. I need a woman willing to fulfill her own duty with a half human Cesari who just prefers men over women. At least I donât have it as bad as Dorian or Nick. They donât even like girls.â

âI donât want the ânormalâ happy life. I want to be happy.â I air quoted normal. I would never be normal. I was weaker and slower than a true Venatori. But my senses were better than any human, I could heal quickly and there was the simple fact that I could bend the elements to my will. And even that talent was rare because I could bend all four elements at the same time. I wasnât limited to just one element. That is what it meant to be Cesari. No, Iâd never be normal.

I sighed setting the card on top of my phone and got up from the couch. âIâm gonna take a shower, then Iâll cook breakfast.â

Mia smiled, âUse our bathroom so you donât wake Naya.â
âJace awake?â

Mia shook her head, âNo. But heâll sleep through you walking through the bedroom.â

âAlright.â

I grabbed my bag of things from the golden half bath and headed into the master bedroom. Jace was groggy, but awake. He mumbled, âCome back to bed, babe.â

I chuckled, âIâd love to, babe, but I need a shower.â

Jace picked his head up and frowned. He blinked away the sleep and rubbed his eyes before he could focus on me. I smiled at him. âMia told me to use your shower.â

He nodded and curled down inside his blankets again with a soft spoken, âStill welcome to join me.â

âI know, man. But I need a shower.â

Jace laughed under the covers, âSuit yourself at the ass crack of dawn.â

Their bathroom was decorated much the same as the one in the hall with soft golden tones everywhere. It must be Miaâs go to color for bathrooms. Either that or someone bought a lot of gold fixtures and needed to use them and they coordinated to it.

The shower was perfect. I always loved showering here, so much better than my own. The jets from every direction were a great feature, but it was the rain head that was the best. It was gentle and covered a large area. Perfect for the heat of the water. And the pressure was perfect without the jets.

It didnât take me long to shower, but the moment I turned off the water and was wrapping a towel around my waist Mia opened the door and smiled at me. âJace says he invited you to bed.â

âHe thought I was you.â I chuckled as I stood in front of her sink applying my eyeliner.

âYou are as bad as any girl. Must wear my make-up, even on the weekend when I can slack off.â

âAt least Iâm not doing my nails or coloring my hair in your sink.â

Mia laughed. âThere is that.â

I dropped the towel to pull my clean boxers on and Mia laughed, âNo boundaries either. I have bacon and eggs, can you make me pancakes too?â She giggled. âI had a reason to come in here, other than to ogle my husbandâs best friend.â

Jace yelled from the opened bathroom door. âHey, I want to ogle him too.â The sheets rustled and in a few moments Jace was standing in the doorway gawking at me. âAw, it ainât nothing I ainât seen before.â

Jace paused as he moved around Mia to come into the bathroom and grabbed me by my shoulders and turned me with force so he could look at my back. âThis looks red and angry.â His voice had grown heated and sharp. âNox, what the fuck? Did you have a nightmare here?â

âJason, I have nightmares every night.â

âThey donât always result in fresh marks, Nox. I thought it was better here?â

âItâs fine.â I stepped away from him and fell against the glass shower wall. âNothing we can do about it.â

âSomeone could do something. I do not believe you hurt yourself over and over again without someone manipulating you, Nox.â

I rolled my eyes. It was the same thing over and over again. Everyone always said the same thing, but there was no proof a dream walker was penetrating my dreams. I sighed before I interrupted his usual rant. âWho the hell wants to fuck with me since I was 6 years old? And why? Iâm nothing!â

Jace turned beet read and Mia pushed him out of the bathroom ahead of her. âWe donât understand. Thatâs all. Why isnât Dr. Silverman doing anything to help you?â

âShe is. We go through it every week. Deal with it every week. I've had walkers sit with me at night and they confirm, I do this to myself. Nothing breaks the nightmares, Mia. Nothing.â I said the last with such defeat it scared me. I was never one to give up on things. It wasnât something I did. To hear it in my voice was saddening. I knew I needed to find that which made me happiest and right now having a family was top on that list of things to try. It was one reason I had agreed to come home with Jace and Mia to be part of a family even if it wasnât my own.

Mia nodded as she left. âWe want to help you Nox, thatâs all.â

I said, âI know,â as she shut the door behind her. I was left alone for the rest of the time I needed to get dressed. I picked up a simple t-shirt that looked like it had been splashed with different shades of oranges, yellows and reds. I pulled my grey hoodie over my arms and settled it on my shoulders before walking out of their bathroom into their bedroom which was empty. I was thankful for that small win.

Jace was in Nayaâs room getting her ready in his boxers and Mia was in the kitchen. The strong smell of fresh brewed coffee was in the air and I walked into the kitchen to find a hot cup sitting on the bar separating the living room and the kitchen. âPancakes?â Mia asked.
I nodded. âAnything for my favorite girl.â

Mia smiled. âI wish youâd find another favorite girl.â

I laughed. âWeâll see.â

Mia picked up my phone on the coffee table and the card that laid on it and set it on the bar. âOr you could call him.â

âWeâll see about that too.â I picked up the card and brought it to my nose and smelled it. It smelled like him, a slight hint of lavender. Mia laughed as I slipped it into my pocket. âCan I listen to music here or do I need my earbuds?â

âYou are good. Naya is up.â Mia grinned. âIâm going to grab a shower. Jace is going to join me. You can manage Naya here?â

I nodded. âOf course. Enjoy the shower.â

Jace walked in and set Naya in her high chair with handful of Cheerios on it and followed Mia to their room.
I picked a playlist that would be least offending to tiny ears. It was all instrumentals of popular songs remade - artists like Apocalyptica, 2Cellos, Lindsey Sterling, and The Piano Guys. âThis will work Naya.â

I made breakfast while Jace and Mia took their shower and other things. I made bacon in the oven on a rack so it was less of a grease fest and pancakes on Miaâs electric griddle. I disliked pancakes myself, but they were always fun to make. I was learning how to make pictures with the batter, but I still sucked at it, so I didnât try this time. The scrambled eggs  finished cooking by the time Mia and Jason walked into the kitchen.

Everyone sat down at the kitchen table and it was the perfect family meal full of chatting and camaraderie. I was so ready for this.



# Unwanted Partnership

My phone vibrated on the bar where I left it. Mia stood up and grabbed it as she was closest. She frowned at it and handed me the offending device, âItâs Daeâlin. Canât she wait till after breakfast?â

Mia sighed. âI suppose it is. Donât take it at the table, please. I broke Jason of the bad habit.â

Nodding I stood up and went into the living room and sat on the couch as I answered the call on the last ring. âHey.â

âIs that how you answer the phone?â Daeâlin scolded me.

âYeah. I knew it was you. And Mia isnât happy you are interrupting breakfast.â

The line went silent for a moment while she was busy doing something. The only sound was tapping of the keyboard. âIâm sorry.â I could hear the frown on her face as she continued, âI forgot that you were out in Brooklyn this morning.â

I smiled. âYouâd think youâd learn to check my schedule, weâve only been doing this dance since I was six.â

âI know. I know. Too busy. I need you in the office today. When are you planning on coming back?â

âAfter breakfast. Jace and Mia have to work.â

âCan you be in my office by 10?â She sounded distracted by the person who had entered her office. Super human hearing had its advantages.

âYeah, Daeâlin. I can be there by 10. Itâs only 6ish now.â I stood up. âI need to get back to my breakfast before it gets too cold.â

â10. Nox. Itâs on your schedule.â Daeâlin said before she hung up the phone.

I tucked my phone back into my hoodie pocket and sat back down at the table with Jaceâs family. Mia smiled at me, âWork call?â

âNo. She was calling to chit-chat. Apparently there is this new eyeliner she wants to know about.â I said, my voice dripping with sarcasm.

Mia rolled her eyes. âWhat time did she want you in?â

âTen. That will work right?â I asked. I knew Jace had class earlier than that on most days.

Jace nodded. âYeah. Though I donât know why Daeâlin would call you for make-up advice.â

âWhy not?â Both Mia and I asked at the same time.

âBecause she does a better job of it than you do. You canât draw a straight line to save your ass. Itâs all crooked.â

Jace reached across the corner of the table where he sat next to me and attempted to smear the crisp lines of my left eye. I dodged out of the way biting at the offending hand. Jace jerked it back to escape my teeth and Naya giggled at the reaction.

Mia rolled her eyes as Jace tried again and I attempted to bite him again with a smile on my lips. Naya was in hysterics. Mia stood up and picked up her baby then frowned at us. âI donât know who is more childish you two or the baby. Iâm thinking itâs the two of you.â She pointed at us with two fingers and gave us that look every parent has perfected that said you are so in trouble.

Jace and I laughed and stood up to clear the table. Jace took my plate from my hands and shooed me away. âI got this. You cooked. I can clean up.â Jace leaned over and whispered, âIf I donât Mia will make me sleep on the couch.â

I laughed as Mia yelled across the room. âI still heard that.â

Mia got the baby ready while I put my things away and made sure I had everything I needed to take with me. They let me keep things here, which was great for impromptu stays. My life could fit into three duffel bags and a backpack, but I owned furniture now.  Though I still  liked to believe I could pick up and go anytime. I wouldnât want to.

We were all in the car by 7am. I got to sit next to Naya in the back seat and we had the cutest dialog half way to the City before she drifted off to sleep. Jace drove into work everyday. I donât think I could manage that. I didnât like driving in cities, and I didnât like driving in New York City of all places.

I preferred being able to do productive things on my commute. Having to pay that much attention for the drive that far would set me on edge and I didnât need more anxiety attacks. I was lucky that having an adult life with no schedule 80% of the time was working it as well as it was. Holidayâs in the Academy killed me. I wasnât good with drastic changes.

We drove into the city and I couldnât help remembering the first time Iâd done so. I was so young then, so afraid of everything. Everything was so flat here. I wasnât used to it, the air was wet and polluted, I hid my nose against my shirt sleeve to keep from having to breathe in all the new smells. It wasnât home.

Dorian sat beside me. Heâd come for me at the airport where my mother left me. She hadnât even said goodbye. She had called me a monster and spit on me only a day before she dragged me on a plane kicking and screaming. The situation terrified me and when we took off my fear jumped into my throat and I cam close to vomiting. My mother did nothing to comfort me. I was a monster. I was no longer her son. She told me that over and over again as we flew from Boulder to JFK.

Once we landed we waited in the terminal for someone to show up. Dorian was an hour late. My mother gave him the wrong time. He was nice, and he smelled like vanilla and cinnamon. After my mother scolded him about being late, he took me to a little red car big enough to fit two people in. It looked like a clown car. My bag fit in the back but it was close. Dorian didnât seem to mind as we drove through the City.

The buildings were so tall. I still awed at them even now that Iâve lived here the rest of my life. We are so small, so inconsequential, yet my life is meant to protect everyone around me. I was gifted with the ability to bend the elements. I didnât think it was a gift in the beginning, but I wouldnât change it for the world. The love of my mother was a big loss for me. There were many losses for me throughout my short life span. But I am grateful for my life - for my experiences. They made me who I am today and Iâm proud of me, even if no one else is.

I knew we were getting close to the Apex Unlimited building - the home of the Venatori. Not all Venatori lived in the building, but seventy percent did. That was an actual number. There were hunters out in the world, and there were other communities - much smaller around the world in small regional headquarters. Or places like Jaceâs family - those people who kept us fed and made money for us.

The entirety of our race could live in the AU building. Some years it was a ghost town, unlike now where there is more Venatori in one place than there had been in centuries. A convergence of power some said, others said it was safety in numbers. But it was a sign that things were changing that was something everyone agreed upon.
Jace parked his big black SUV in the parking garage. And he and his family headed for the elevator. I walked with them until the doors opened and my fear of heights overwhelmed my senses. The elevator looked innocuous now, but I knew once it was at ground level again, it would open into the lobby and you could see everything around you through the plate glass walls. My heart was in my throat. My pulse raced through my body. I shook my head and forced a smile on my face I knew didnât reach my eyes. âIâm gonna take the stairs.â

Jace nodded and wrapped an arm around my shoulders in farewell before he joined his wife and daughter. I waved at Naya as the doors closed and I made my way to the stairs.

I took the stairs two at a time for 28 flights. It was nothing. Iâd done the entire ground to roof before. Some days I did it instead of going for a run.

It was still early for my appointment with Daeâlin, but I went that direction anyway. The Venatori headquarters was a place that was always busy. It was also the only place in the building where youâd find many supernatural creatures. At night we even had a few vampires who worked with us. Itâs not how youâd think it would look with a bunch of magical beings walking around. This isnât tv itâs real life. Everyone is mostly human looking. The vampires have fangs, but most are retractable and short of their pale complexions youâd never know what they were. Same goes for the were-wolves, were-bears, and well anything were, or more appropriately called Therians. They are humans infected with the Lycanthropy virus of specific creatures all of which are predators. They change once a month at the full moon, and only the strongest of them can change at will.

We even have a dragon working as a receptionist. Her name is Mabel, and she collects pens. A cup of pens lined her desk. You may not use the pens in the cups on her desk. If you want to get on Mabelâs good side you buy her a unique pen - chances are she already has it, but sheâll like you more for trying.

All dragons collect things - itâs in their nature. But short of the collections, youâd never know they were anything but human. I couldnât name any supernatural creature we monitored and policed that couldnât at least pull off being human. But there were monster monsters we hunted when they became an issue for society, but most of our job was to make sure the species that made up the Clandestine Providence didnât prey on the weak and soft humans who knew nothing of the world we lived in, yet were the reason the Clandestine Providence existed.

Lost in my head I ran into someone striding down the halls in front of me. It wasnât a bad collision, but my chest ached where the big hulk of a shoulder rammed into my solar plexus. Rude much? But when I looked up to see who Iâd run into to apologize I saw a pair of identical chocolate eyes staring back at me.

I dropped my gaze to the floor. âIâll watch where Iâm going next time.â I moved to step around my father and go about my business.

He caught my arm and turned me to face him. âBoy, whatâs your problem? You are always in your head. I canât believe they let you hunt if you are so easily distracted.â

I sighed and glared at my father. He was always finding something wrong with me and the way I did things. He thought he was making up for all the time heâd not known about my existence, but I was a grown man by the time he found out I was his son. The irony of it is I had looked up to Kai Viddens my entire life. He was one of the best hunters out there. His record was untarnished. He was a man who the women adored, and he was the hunter every kid wanted to be, especially me.

But by the time Iâd found out he was my father my self imposed bitterness against my biological father was so ingrained and entwined with my mommy issues that my daddy issues were too strong. I despised the man who gave me life as I despised the woman who did. It was difficult for me to differentiate between the two ideologies in my mind. I was working on it with my therapist, but I wasnât there yet and neither was my father.

Kai shook me again, âSee there you go again.â

But I didnât have to say anything. I smelled the soft scent of my savior coming my way. His voice was deep, and he had nothing but a smile for me when I looked at him as he came around the corner. Dorian Vega. The one man who I respected more than anyone else. He was the father figure I had as a child. He was my friend now. Dorian smiled at Kai and touched the hands there gripping my shoulders and Kai removed his tight grip on me. âNox is safe here, he lets his mind wander. He is not so careless outside of the safe zone of the Apex Unlimited Building.â

Kai glared at Dorian. âMind your own business, Dorian. My son and I were having a discussion.â

Dorian laughed. âYour son is my business. Or had you forgotten?â

The fury on my fatherâs face grew, he turned red and the vein in his forehead pulsed. âI did not know he existed, or I would have done something about this attitude of his. You raised my boy to be a fucking fag.â

I stepped between my father and Dorian and put my hand on my fatherâs chest and shoved him backwards. âDorian did not make me a fag. I did not turn Nick into a fag. We were born the way we were born and there is nothing you can do about it.â My sexuality was another of my fatherâs hang ups. I liked men get over it. I also liked women, but that fact seemed to escape him. What made it worse was that I had kissed my brother.

Neither Nick nor I had known we were brothers. How could we when I didnât know who my father was until I was 18. We were in the same classes for most of our lives. He liked boys, I liked boys. We kinda hooked up for a little while. We got caught kissing in the hallway on our way to do more intimate things and I was told to stay away from Nick by Kai Viddens, Daeâlin and Dorian. So I did. But only because Dorian had asked, not told me to.

Dorian put his hand on my shoulder and guided me around Kai. âNox, go meet with Daeâlin. Sheâs ready if you are. Even though itâs early you donât look too busy.â

I nodded, and I left Kai staring daggers at my mentor and friend and hoped that I hadnât made things worse for Dorian. It was bad enough that Kai and Dorianâs father were partners. Kai was a friend of the family. I was a friend of the family but that only made the strain worse. I caused problems everywhere I went.

Daeâlinâs office wasnât too far from the encounter with my father. I knocked on the closed door and the voice that made me jump all my life called out, âEnter.â And I had no choice but to obey. She still made me jump at her commands though now I could ignore then if I wanted to. But I tried not to do that lest she tell me to go to hell and Iâd have to work for someone I didnât like. The office was small, and it was already full. Another man, I knew his face but not his name, sat in the corner chair leaving the one by the door for me while Daeâlin sat behind her desk tapping away at the computer in front of her.

Daeâlin raised her head and tucked a strand of straight raven black hair behind her hear. Her eyes widened in surprise. âNox you are early?â She looked at the time on her watch as she added, âYou are never early.â

âI was in the neighborhood.â I smiled. âI can come back.â

Daeâlin shook her head, âNo, no. Sit down.â She pointed her whole hand at the man in the corner with her palm facing up. âThis is Walker Moore. Walker this is Nox SÃ©tanta. I would like him to help you on your current task, Walker. Nox is very knowledgeable about the Cityâs undercurrents and the dragons of the city in particular.â

He sighed. âHe is also the hunter with the lowest count.â

I laughed as I sat down in the other chair. âMy record is higher than my fatherâs. Just because I donât kill them, doesnât mean it doesnât count.â

Walker frowned. âYou cheat. We shouldnât work with the creatures we hunt.â

I hated this bigotry. It was everywhere for everything. Your sexuality, your gender, your race, your species. Youâd think a secret society hidden inside the human world would be bigger than the humans they protected, but no we were worse than any human could ever be. I sighed. âDaeâlin I canât work with him.â I stood up to leave.

But Daeâlin called me out. âNox. Stop.â I had no choice but to comply. âWalker needs your help. I wouldnât assign you this unless I didnât think youâd be an asset to the problem at hand. Walker is hunting a bank robber. We have her on camera using her fire breath to scare the patrons. This wasnât her first bank robbery, and it wonât be her last. Just the first where we had to cover up what the patrons saw. So we need to find her before things get out of hand.â

âSo why do you need me? Sounds like a pretty cut and dry case. Dragonâs are never far from their hoards. Sheâll always go home.â I said.

Daeâlin frowned. âWalker is just off his first hunt, I thought it was an easy case since we had an image to go from, not just rumors. But heâs hunted outside the City for his first hunt, tracking outside is easy, inside the cement and concrete of New York City, itâs not as easy as it seems.â

Walker interjected, âItâs not just that Daeâlin. Sheâs not following any patterns. I donât know the city well enough yet.â

âNox, he needs your help. Walker will chill with his sentiments while he works with you. Wonât you Walker?â

âYes, maâam.â He said as he stared back at me.

Daeâlin continued oblivious to the look I was getting. If looks could kill Iâd be fighting for my life but she whispered. âAnd Walker, Nox is lead now. You need his contacts. They wonât talk to you.â

âWhy would anyone talk to him?â He quipped.

I smiled. âBecause Iâm not a bigoted ass and I can charm just about anyone.â I gave him an evil grin, âExcept maybe you.â

âWhatâs that supposed to mean?â Walker asked as he stood up.

Daeâlin was rolling her eyes as we left the office. She mumbled to herself, âI hope they donât kill each other.â

I gave Daeâlin a flourishing bow in response to her spoken comments. She turned a bright shade of pink and I grinned back at her. I did very much love proving that I was not human weak.



# Hunting in the City

Ever since my first hunt I had avoided working with anyone. Itâs not that Michaela was a bad partner. We disagreed on everything. She was a kill first ask questions later type of girl. Most Venatori hunters were of the same mind. They didnât care why a supernatural being was doing something. They put an end to the current law being broken and didnât care about anything else.

No one cared when a vengeful ghost possessed a little girl and then went on a killing spree starting with their murderer, but I did. I tried to save the little girl in my first hunt, but it came down to my life or hers and I had to kill her with the ghost inside.  Later when I was out on my own, I could explore the reasons behind the ghosts actions. Turned out, an abused boy possessed the little girl.  His own father beat him and later killed him.  After killing his father, the ghost killed every other person who didnât stop the abuse but knew about it, until I stopped him.

It wouldnât have changed the outcome but there was a reason, maybe if Iâd understood in the beginning I could have done different things. I tried to see things from their side because I was more on their side than any other side. I wasnât Venatori - not fully anyway, and I wasnât human either. The line that every hunter drew in the sand, I straddled it daily. But, I choose my path, and no one liked working with me because of it. I was okay with that.

Walker was no different. He eyed me up and down as we walked. I had no destination, but we walked. He turned to the elevators and pushed the button to go up. I took a deep breath and pushed the anxiety away.

We ascended 14 floors in the plate glass elevator that overlooked the middle of the AU Building. The height was dizzying as we moved up and even closing my eyes didn't stop the anxiety from rising the higher we rose.

When the door opened, I hurried out and Walker was chuckling. âBig bad hunter afraid of heights?â

I shrugged. âIt doesnât stop me from doing anything. I take it you are hungry?â

Walker nodded. âYou mind if we work and eat at the same time? Or donât you like to socialize, always choosing to eat in your apartment?â

He was being snide and condescending and it was something I was used to. âI socialize just fine.â With those I felt worthy of my time. Most people in the cafeteria were not.

The line waiting for their own food was short.  I grabbed a bottle of water, a banana and some yogurt left over from breakfast. It wasnât quite lunch, but there was more lunch than breakfast being served.

A friendly face peaked over the hot serving line. âHey, darling. Hold up. I got something for you.â Ms. Sheila's southern drawl was never quite removed from her personality.  It made me wonder if she exaggerated just for the sake of being different.  I know it was something I would do.

I raised my eyebrow in question as Ms. Sheila hurried off into the back of the cooking area to fetch something. Walker grinned. âYou like them all sorts of ways donât you.â

âI do.â I wouldn't let him get under my skin.

At that moment Ms. Shelia in her dyed pink hair - it was supposed to be auburn, but it always came out pink. She said she tried to fix it, but so many people loved it she kept it that way. That was shy of 15 years ago. She handed me a bag with a wink. âDonât look at it until you leave the line.â

âOkay.â I smiled at her and then blew her a kiss which elicited a snicker and a giggle from Ms. Shelia.

âAlways the charmer. Iâm surprised Mia hasnât found you a young lady to settle down with yet.â

I waved at her with another smile. âOh, sheâs trying.â

Walker was waiting for me at an empty table. The cashier scanned my ID, and the charges applied to my account for the day. But Iâd gotten a free meal or something out of it. It was worth coming down to the cafeteria some days. Ms. Shelia enjoyed spoiling me.

I sat down in front of Walker and set my tray on the table while I put the bag in my lap to see what was in it.

Walker leaned over the table trying to grab a peak too. âYou must be a good lay to get special treatment.â

âMs. Shelia likes me, what can I say.â I said with grandiose voice. Ms. Shelia treated me like her own son. She looked after the small skinny kid who ate the same thing everyday at the same time. I was so bad as a child, Ms. Shelia made my plate before I got there, and putting new things on it for me to try.

It was one of those change a little at a time so I donât freak out moments. The first time it happened I hyperventilated and passed out and Dae'lin took me to the infirmary where she later bitched at me for freaking out, which sent me into another attack and on and on for three hours until Dorian came and calmed me down. I was a fucking mess.

Iâm not much better now, but now I know how to cope. Iâm not five anymore.

In the bag was a large freshly baked loaf of bread, still warm from the oven.  I wasnât a big carb eater but one of my weaknesses was fresh bread. The moist warmth radiating up from the bag made me wonder if Ms. Sheila knew I would be downstairs for breakfast, but it didn't matter.

I tore a piece off and offered Walker the piece he shook his head. âNo thanks.â He made no snide remarks which surprised me. But I was thankful.

The cafeteria was loud and noisy and I ate the piece as Walker stabbed the canned vegetables that were likely very bland. I frowned. âI can make you better than that.â

He looked up and frowned at me. âSo you do cook?â

âI do. I taught myself how when I was 10.â

âWhy?â

âBecause I needed more food, than I could get in the cafeteria.â In the middle of the last word my tray swooshed across the table. I looked up to the now towering black man over my side of the table. âNice to see you too, Aaron.â  My voice dripped with sarcasm.

My former roommate looked over at Walker and frowned, âYou buddying up with him?â

Walker grinned. âIf I am. You gonna throw my tray across the table too?â

Aaron ignored me. âI donât suppose so, why you with the fag?â  He grabbed the top of my head and messed my hair up in attempt to piss me off.

âRivera assigned my case to him. "  Disdain and disapproval rolled off his tongue.  "Heâs lead on the dragon robbery now. Iâm sure sheâll get captured and tried and some other lucky guy gets to kill her instead of me.â

I interjected, âYou could still kill her, if it all came down to it. Just make it a condition of working with me. Iâm sure theyâll obliged you. Who likes killing a creature theyâve not had to hunt down, at least you volunteer and you did the work to get here there.â

Walker looked at me like I was crazy. I added. âIâve never worked with anyone before there has been no one to make the claim. I donât see why if sheâs found guilty that you canât do the deed. Iâm not going to.â

Aaron laughed. âWuss.â

I shrugged. âI can take your ass any day, Aaron.â

âOh really?â He grabbed the back of my neck.

I wove a solid bar of air between me and Aaron and used it as a lever to bring him to the ground and I was on top of him as he landed, my knee on the base of his throat. He was looking up at me in with wide black eyes and I smiled down at him.

âReally.â I stood up and offered him a hand up. âI donât have to play nice anymore, Aaron. Remember that.â

He slapped my hand away instead of allowing me to help him. He frowned at Walker and walked away from us.

Walker refrained from laughing until the big black bully of my youth was out of ear shot. âI will have to remember you donât fight fair.â

âDo you plan on fighting with me?â I asked as I finished the bread in the bag since my sudolunch was gone.

He shook his head and blond strands fell over his gray eyes before he pushed it back into place. On another day he might be cute, but I didnât mix work with pleasure.

âSo. What do you have on your mysterious dragon?â I asked so we could begin the audious task of hunting dragons.

Walker pulled his laptop out of his bag.  After everything booted up he pulled up several files. âThese are the photos we got of her using her fire breath. We have little more than these pictures.â

âYou try to finger her for other robberies?â I asked.

âI did. Facial recognition was crap, she never looked at the camera. They did a good job casing it.â

âWhat did she take? Money? Stuff out of the safety deposit boxes?â

âReports says she took nothing.â

âWhat?â I was confused now. âNothing?â

âShe put in a USB stick into all the computers and ran a program. In other cases she took the money from the drawer. But that was it. Other than sheâs a dragon we could let the police handle her.â

âIâd like to know what they put in the system.â

âThe human police wonât tell us anything.â Walker frowned. âThey have a security group working on it. Wonât say who. Our contacts canât get shit from them. Maybe itâs just cause Iâm a newb. I donât know.â

I got up and sat down next to Walker so we could both look at the laptop and loo at the pictures. She never looked at the camera, but her man had a leather jacket with a patch on it. âDid we get any good pictures of this here?â I pointed to it.

Walker shrugged. âI donât know. Why?â

âI think I know the patch.â I frowned, if I was right this was not a good thing.

We searched the few images that Walker had, but there wasnât much to go on. The image however got clearer in one and it was a patch I recognized. I pointed at the image. âZoom in here?â

Walker looked at me with disgust. âWhat?â I asked. âItâs your laptop. I will not presume to use it.â

Walker smirked. âI figured maybe you didnât know how.â He pushed the laptop my way.

I used the track pad to zoom in to the patch. I could make out the dragon head even though the picture was pixalated. âIâve never seen it on a patch before. The Last Phoenix tattoo their skin or use brands. They donât wear leather jackets. But they are very much like a biker gang.â

âThe Last Phoenix?â Walker asked.

âA dragon gang. They are harmless - for the most part.â I stood up and closed the laptop lid. âLetâs go to the Archives. We can find out where they like to hang out.â

Walker put his things away and laughed, âWhat, you donât know where they like to hang out? I thought you were tight with the monsters.â

âI wouldnât say tight.â I grinned at him. âI have two friends who are supernatural in nature.â

We left the cafeteria, but I didnât get far. A woman stopped in front of me, she looked back at her friends with a giggle and then back at me with her bright green eyes. I remembered her from school.  

She smiled at me. âHi. That was a pretty cool move.â

I smiled. âNothing special. What can I do for you?â

Her green eyes sparkled as she glanced back at her friends again who were nodding at her. âI bet you donât remember me. Iâm Beatrice Magellan.â

âI remember you Treec. Youâve lost weight. You look good.â Treec had been a large girl as a child. It was uncommon as a Venatori. Our metabolism prevented it. But some of us didnât get the better part of the gene pool - to heavy on the human DNA.

Walker grabbed my arm. âCome on, letâs go. We have a job to do.â

âSoon as Treec asks me what she wanted to ask me.â I gave the girl with some nice curves a smile, âWell Treec?â

She blushed. âI was hoping we could talk over dinner sometime.â

âTalk about what?â I asked.

âI heard you were almost up on timeâ¦ â She paused and looked back at your friends yet again, then back at me like she as a blush crept up her neck and over her cheeks.

I couldn't help but grin while I waited for her to finish her question.

We stared at each other for several seconds. âup on what?â I asked with a mischievous smile.

She sighed and her blush grew deeper. âI heard you were looking for partners to umâ¦ have children.â

âI am.â I pulled my phone out. âHow about Monday night at 6pm?â

Treec shrugged. âReally? I didnât think youâd be interestedâ¦â

âInterested in you?â I asked, and she blushed again. âWhy?â

She looked down and shuffled her foot against the floor before she spoke quietly, âIâm not your usual type.â

I took her hand and lifted it to my lips. âI donât have a type, Duckling. 6pm on Monday. Iâll pick you up and weâll go out.â

She nodded, and she turned redder as she turned back to her friends.

I started for the door and Treecâs friends all giggled as I walked by. I gave them a flourished bow as I passed them with a wink. The cafeteria was back to its original state. We left the noisy chaos.

Walker laughed as we walked out. âWhy agree to meet with her?â

âWhy not?â

Walker shrugged, âSheâs not hot. I thought you could do better?â

âBetter than what?â I asked. âShe was in the top of her class. Sheâs an empath, thatâs not a bad gift to have. And sheâs full Venatori. Her family is related to the ruling houses through marriage. Her mother was a Haskins. But sheâs got great green eyes, I'm sucker for eyes.â

âIf you didnât notice sheâs rather large.â Walker smirked.

I groaned. âReally? She canât be a good lay because sheâs got more meat on her? You ainât had enough sex Walker.â

He stuttered. âI. I. You donât know anything about me. Iâve had plenty of sex. Iâve never had any complaints.â

âIâm sure you havenât. A fine body like that has to have moves. But Iâve seen guys like you fail horrifically in bed.â

âDonât get any ideas. I donât roll that way.â  Walker sneered.

I laughed. âMost guys donât. I would never hit on you unless I was one, out trying to pick up a guy, or two, you would seem to welcome my advanced.â

âYou could tell Iâm not gay?â

âWhat are your vibes about me?â I asked.

âI donât know. You wear make up, but you donât dress like a gay guy.â

âBut Iâm gay?â

âI guess. Though you said yes to a girl so I donât know. Iâm confused.â

I grinned, âGlad to confuse you. But honestly, I donât really like the big macho men.â I smiled. âNo offense.â

âYou like the nerds?â Walker laughed.

I shook my head, âNo, not the nerds per se. They donât have to be brainiacs.â

In our chatting we managed the stairs down to the Archives and Walker hadnât mentioned my avoidance of the elevator. Either he hadnât noticed, or he didnât care and would rather talk about the people I liked. Either way we were at the Archives door and Walker looked at it with concern. âWe could have been here a few minutes ago. You manipulated me.â

I grinned as I pushed the wide double doors open. âItâs amazing what a distraction can do.â

The Archives were huge compared to the smaller library in the Academy. It had amazed me the first time I had walked into it with Dorian so many years ago. The front desk was in the middle of a two story circular room filled with shelves from floor to ceiling. I knew each of those books housed the continuous history of every Venatori and supernatural creature we had on record. The woman at the front desk knew what was in every single one of those volumes.

I leaned on the desk and smiled at the green eyed woman behind the counter. She had black hair that was graying. I knew her through her son, and you could clearly see the features Dorian had inherited from his mother. âI do not know why you married a face like Mr. Vega.â

The woman turned with a huge grin. âProbably, because you were too young.â

âIâve been told I look like my father.â I said politely trying not to sound bitter about it.

âYou do, darling. You may have your fatherâs eye color but your eyes are that of your mother. I see none of Kai in them.â Her eyes were sad. She knew my parentage, the way I grew up. Knew how I felt about my parents. She turned her attentions to the man behind me. âWalker, how is your mother these days?â

âSheâs doing fine maâam. Thank you for asking.â Walker smiled at Mrs. Vega and offered his hand.

âWhat can I do for you boys?â Mrs. Vega asked. âI rarely see the young ones, besides Nox that is,  come in here.â

âYour knowledge is invaluable, Mrs. Vega. This is your lifeâs work. Why wouldnât I come get the answers from the one person who would know them? The computers are all well and good, but they donât work as well as the Venatori memory in that pretty little head of yours. Dorian got his memory honest.â

Mrs. Vega shook her head, âWhat are you looking for today?â

âThe Last Phoenix, theyâve been in the City for some time. The vampires are keeping tabs on them and I think the wolves too. When dragons come to town, the others know. I needâ¦â Walker cleared his throat. âWe need to find out where they might hang out. We think one of their numbers is pulling off bank robberies or they are helping someone else do them. Either way their symbol is on a jacket of one of the robbers. But I donât think heâs a dragon. He has no shadows.â

âShadows?â Walker asked.

âNox, is not your ordinary run of the mill Magnus.â Mrs. Vega smiled.

âI know heâs Cesari.â  Walker declared proud of his knowledge.

âHeâs more than that. Whatâs your gift, young Walker?â Mrs. Vega asked.

âI have infrared vision. Itâs really annoying at times when I canât figure out how to turn it off.â

âThat could come in handy.â I interjected as I made note.

Walker asked with interest, âWhatâs yours?â

âI see patterns.â I shrugged. âThe way things fall, the surrounding patterns that make up every object. Dragonâs have a shadow of their dragon form around them. I can see it, even in images. Itâs pretty amazing that it comes through when Magnus ability doesnât.â

Mrs. Vega slipped around the corner of the front desk and started towards the towering shelves. âI think I remember Hanley use to own a bar, the Last Phoenix use to use as a front. Hanleyâs been dead going on 20 years now, but his son still runs the place.â She muttered to herself. âUgly Deer Tavern.â

She climbed up the ladder attached to the wall and stepped up a few rungs and reached a book that had the same insignia on it. Mrs. Vega flipped through a few pages. âThe Ugly Dog Saloon. "  She said tapping it in the book where she found it's listing.  "Itâs on First Avenue between 8th and 9th. Or it was. But Derek seems to keep it up and running so I assume itâs still in the same place. Heâs never filed a change of address.â

âDoes Derek have a last name?â  I asked

âMontrey.â

âThank you Mrs. Vega.â I said as she reached the ground. I appreciate it.

âYou are welcome as always, Nox. Walker itâs a pleasure seeing you again, wish your mother my best when you see her. You boys take care.â And she was back to the front desk before we could even respond.

âIt looks like we are going drinking tonight!â I said with a smile.

Walker just grinned back at me.



# Before the Storm 

We still had plenty of time before the bar even opened.  It was still early in the morning.  We'd left the Archives and Walker headed straight for the elevator. "So what time do you want to hit the Ugly Dog Saloon?  Google says they don't open till 5pm.  And that's a little early for me."  Walker smiled.  "Does 8 work for you?"

"Sure.  I'll meet you downstairs?"

Walker nodded.  "All right.  See you then."

The elevator doors closed, and I heard my phone go off with the random person text.  I fished my phone out of my pocket and saw the name "Mysterious blue-eyed boy" written across the top.

I read the message.

> Mysterious blue-eyed boy  
> 646-555-2915  
> Sat, 06/23/2015  
> ****  
> I didn't think you'd call, Nox.  Still haven't, really.  
> 11:31 AM  

Mia had my phone earlier - she must have messaged him.  I frowned at my phone as I scrolled up to read what she'd sent. 

> Me  
> 646-555-4512  
> Sat, 06/23/2015  
> ****  
> Hey Sage.  I figured I'd introduce myself.  I'm Nox.  I had a good time last night.   
> 6:45 AM  

I sighed and hit the call button and I could feel my stomach flutter as it rang.  A familiar voice answered.  "Okay, I really didn't expect to hear from you now.  Hi, Nox."

"Hi.  I wanted to call and say I didn't send that message.  But it wasn't a lie."

Sage laughed.  "If you didn't send it then who did?"  

He sounded amused.  "Mia did." I answered.

"Who's Mia?"  There was a hint of jealousy in his voice as he asked.

"Mia is the wife of my best friend.  I went home with them this weekend to see my goddaughter.  She picked up my phone and your card was sitting on top of it this morning."

Sage laughed.  "I thought she was your girlfriend.  I'm glad to find out she's not."

"Not like ever."  I grinned.  "I did have a good time last night."

I headed for the stairs as I listened to Sage speak.  "I did too.  I honestly didn't expect you to call.  Alice says she gave you her number, and you never called."

"I'm sorry, I don't know who Alice is.  I don't keep phone numbers.  But you took something of mine.  I was left wanting and intrigued."  I confided.

"I figured as much since you shagged her on the dance floor.  But I had to try.  Right?"

I had to ask.  "Did you know what you'd find in my back pocket?"

Sage laughed.  "No.  But I'm assuming since I took them you did little that night?"

"I went home with Jace and Mia and I danced with a pretty, little brunette, went for a swim and then fell out of bed."

"Why did you fall out of bed?"  Sage sounded concerned.

"A nightmare.  Nothing to worry about.  Yoga helps with the anxiety from waking up like that."

Sage hummed into the phone.  "So you are flexible?"

I couldn't help but laugh.  "I suppose so.  You want to find out?"

Sage hummed again.  "Maybe."

I grinned as my body tightened, I knew he couldn't see it. "Maybe one day soon?" I asked  

"I'd like that."  My body grew tighter yet, and I bit back a groan.  Sage laughed, "Stop biting your bottom lip."

I licked my lips as I did as he asked.  "How did you know?"

"All night, when we danced, you kept biting your bottom lip and all I wanted to do was suck it in to my mouth and bite it myself."

I laughed, "Why didn't you?"

Sage joined me in my laughter.  "I didn't want to seem desperate or for you to think I was going to sleep with you."

My phone beeped through and I glanced at it.  It was a text from Walker.  I put the phone back to my ear.  "Sage, I need to go.  I got partnered with a new guy at work and he's texted me.  I need to answer it."

"That's all right I need to get back to work too.  Boss has me on a tight deadline."  Sage sounded a little disappointed.  "When you are done dealing with your new partner, send me a text.  I like talking with you.  It's almost as good as dancing with you."

I smiled to myself.  "All right. I'll talk with you later, Sage."

"Bye, Nox."  The other side of the line went dead, and I took a deep breath.  I was so out of my element.  I never called anyone, I didn't keep their numbers to do that.  But just the thought of that blue-eyed boy made my body tighten in all the right places.

I took a look at Walker's text.

I sighed and tucked my phone in my pocket and headed into the gym to do a quick work out since I was going to have to miss my evening one due to work.  Maybe I could schedule a lunch with Treeca.  I checked my schedule, and I found a new appointment for this afternoon - Dr. Hillary Silas wanted a one on one in thirty minutes.

I headed to the Infirmary instead to meet with my so-called Progeny Program Agent.  The Infirmary was where Venatori went to get patched up.  It was also where research was done and supernatural creatures could come for their ailments.

But it held other offices that medical professionals were needed among the Venatori including therapists which I have utilized since I was 6 years old.  But today I was going for my obligation to the Venatori species.

Dr. Silas' office was a few halls from Margo's.  But that wasn't surprising since all the offices were in one place.  I was still a few minutes early.  I knocked on the door and when there was no answer I opened the door.  But it opened into an office filled with books.  No one was inside so I closed the door and stood outside.  

Leaning against the wall, I pulled my phone out and found my mysterious contact.  I think Mia thought I would change it once I realized it, but I liked it.  I knew his name, but I still thought of him as my mysterious blue-eye boy.  

> Me  
> 646-555-4512  
> Sat, 06/23/2015  
> ****  
> Waiting outside an appointment. I want to see you again.  
> 11:45 AM  

I sighed.  I was sounding desperate.  Why was I doing this?  

The familiar blond came into my peripherals.  "Mr. SÃ©tanta.  You are early."

"One of my many quirks."  I grinned.

My phone went off, but I slid it back into my pocket and followed Dr. Silas into her office.

It was cramped and full of books and paper the only two surfaces not covered in stuff was the two chairs.  She was very disorganized, and I shuddered.  I hoped she knew where everything was.  Otherwise this might take a while.

I sat down in the chair that looked well used but not by humanoid posteriors, more like books.  "So, Dr. Silas, where did you want to start?"

"Mr. SÃ©tanta."

I interrupted. "Nox."

She sighed and continued.  "Nox.  Do you have intentions to fulfill your obligation, or do you want us to begin the search for a compatible mate?"

"You should probably start looking.  I don't think the women I know will want a quarter human child."

"You are Cesari and one of the most powerful Magnus we've had in generations.  Your display still stands in the center lobby.  Why would any woman of child bearing age not one the possibility of having their progeny become even stronger?  With the right breeding you could have the strongest Magnus ever born."  She smiled at me, "Dr. Eriksen has given me a list of women that would be excellent matches for you."

"How many of them know they are excellent matches for me?"  I asked.

"Well.  None, as yet.  We do not have their agreements.  But we could easily gain their participation."  Dr. Silas piled papers on top of other papers, laying them out like I was going to choose now.

"Tell me.  Dr. Silas, would you sleep with me if you thought we'd make powerful babies?"  I had on my serious face when she looked up.  

She frowned.  "I'm... I... No, you are not my type."

I smiled.  "So even if Dr. Eriksen came to you and said our babies would produce the most powerful Magnus and Venatori ever, would you sleep with me then?"

"Well... No.  I don't see how this has any bearing on anything.  I'm not a candidate at all."

I sighed.  "You are a normal heterosexual Venatori woman.  While I am several years younger than you even the prospect of power is not enticing enough for you - a normal woman - to sleep with me to produce this new power.  What makes you think any woman on that list is going to sleep with me because Dr. Eriksen says so."  

"Let's start with me telling you what I want out of this arrangement with a woman.  I don't want a relationship.  I want someone who is willingly in my bed, to produce an heir.  I want to have at least partial custody of any children produced.  I want a family."  That was what I wanted.

"Mr. SÃ©tanta, that isn't how this works.  We are not a dating service."

I rolled my eyes.  "Then, Dr Silas,"  I stood up and turned for the door, "We are done here.  I have one prospect woman with a meeting Monday night to discuss our wants and needs.  I will notify you if we make an arrangement."

I opened the door and closed it behind me louder than I should have.

After I got a few doors away from her office, I pulled out my phone and I looked at the last message Sage had sent.  

> Mysterious blue-eyed boy   
> 646-555-2915  
> Sat, 06/23/2015  
> ****  
> Maybe.  Soon. :)  
> 11:45 AM  

I smiled.  But here I was flirting with a guy when I had to deal with making an heir.

> Me

The last message sent, and I walked up the stairs to my apartment.  I might as well go start lunch now.  I wasn't starving but I could eat.  I should eat.

I unlocked my door as my phone rang.  It was just the default ring tone.  I answered it, "Hello?"  I didn't even look at the name and number because it was so rare for it to not ring with at least a Venatori ring tone.

"Hey, Nox.  Is it something you can talk about over the phone?"  I smiled.

"I can.  But it's probably something better to do in person.  I'm making lunch if you want to come over."  My heart raced and I could feel my palms sweating.  I had just asked him out.  I hated my anxiety!

Sage chuckled on the other side of the phone.  "You are cooking?"

"Yeah."  I smiled.  "I'm an awesome cook."

"I think I could use a break.  I'll see you in a few if you give me an address."

"I'll text you the address."  And that's what I did.

"I'll see you in ten."

I hung up the phone and panic set in.  Fuck, I asked him over.  I asked him out.  I couldn't breathe.  
I needed to calm down.  Sliding down against my door, I took a deep breath and preformed a calming exercise.  Five things I could see.  The coffeemaker.  The water maker in the fridge.  The picture of the night skyline of the City.  The leather couch.  And the fruit bowl on the counter.  I could do this.  

I stood up and listened for four things I could hear.  A deep breath.  That was one sound.  The drop of ice in the ice maker.  The hum of the air conditioning.  The sound of my heart beat.  I could hear it in my ears.  But it was slowing down.

I was feeling better.  Three things I could touch.  The coffee beans as I pour them into the grinder.  The counter beneath my fingers.  The cool touch of my phone in my hand.  

Two things I could smell.  Coffee beans as they brewed.  The soft scent of vanilla and cinnamon.   I turned to the door to find Dorian standing in the door I had only left a few moments ago.

One thing I could taste? I smiled at Dorian and pulled a mug from the cabinet above the coffeemaker and poured a cup of coffee.  I swallowed slowly feeling the warmth go down and the bitter taste.  It wasn't heaven, but it was helping to calm my nerves.

Dorian stood there watching me and waited until I was done drinking the coffee.  "You okay?" he asked.

I nodded.  "I just asked a boy to come over for lunch."

Dorian's smile widened.  "Then I should probably leave.  Dr. Silas called me asking about your propensity to leave in a huff."

I let out a curt laugh, "Hah!  She is a piece of work.  I have a girl lined up to talk to."

Sage was standing in the door when I said that and he was frowning, "A girl lined up for what?"

I sighed, "Come in.  I'll explain.  Dorian, I'm okay.  I have a few things to talk about with my friend."

Dorian nodded.  "I hope to see you again," he said to Sage.

Sage came in and shut the door.  "A girl?"

"Prearranged child bearing women.  Is basically what I'm dealing with.  Here in the Apex Unlimited community we are regulated.  It's not like outside in the real world.  We are required to breed with other individuals and bear two heirs.  I had five years to produce one, I'm down to one year left.  You walked in when I was explaining to Dorian that I have a meeting with a girl to talk about it.  The meeting I was in was to discuss the same thing.  That woman who was at the club last night she was hounding me to do my duty."

Sage nodded and took the cup of coffee from me.  "And how do I factor in to all this?  I'm not just some one night stand, Nox."

"I know.  I don't want you to be.  But I have to do this.  I can't get out of it not without a big penalty and big pay decrease and I wouldn't be surprised if they kicked me out altogether.  Look Sage," I smiled at him hoping to lessen the sting of what I'd said.  "I like you.  I don't want to hurt you but I have to do this."

Sage put the cup down and pinned me against the counter.  "I like you, too.  These girls, you gonna marry them?"

I shook my head.  "No.  I only want to have access to my children.  Let them live with me but that might not happen."

"You want a family?"

I nodded.  "Yes.  I do."

"And what about a significant other?"

I chuckled, "Well, I think I'm working on that."

Sage grinned and moved away from me with the coffee cup in his hand and finished my coffee.  "You said something about lunch?"

I nodded.  "I did."

Sage took a seat at the bar while I got out things to make for lunch.  I could impress him, but I didn't want to look anymore desperate than he did, or how I already sounded.  Chicken salad spread on rye with Swiss and a good mustard should do it.  I had a prepared humus from a few days ago, some raw vegetables would work with some crackers since I wasn't sure what Sage would think of the uber health nut I had become.

I could feel Sage's eyes on my back as I set things down.  "You want something other than coffee to drink?  I have some Orange Juice, water, beer, though it's a bit early for that and, of course,y coffee?"  I turned to Sage who was sipping at a fresh cup of coffee. 

"I'm good."  He held up the coffee with quick grin before sipping at the steaming cup of joe and watching me with sparkling blue eyes peaking over the top of his mug.

I nodded and pulled a second mug down and poured myself another.  I started another pot, this one was almost gone.

"You drink a lot of coffee?"  Sage asked.

"Not usually.  Just a morning thing, but it's been a stressful morning."  I answered as the next pot brewed.  

I set my now full cup down at the empty bar stool next to Sage and prepped our lunch.  "It's nothing fancy, I wasn't expecting to be feeding anyone other than myself."

Sage laughed.  "Hey, I'm not going to complain.  I'm not making it, and it's not fast food.  It'll be the best meal I've had in weeks.  This project my boss has me on is killing me.  I should be working, but my brain is fried.  I needed an hour off, and I told him so."

"I'm sure that went over well."  I grinned as I spread the mustard on the rye bread. 

Sage chuckled, "My boss, Eric, is great.  He said, 'I saw those typos you were hunting.'  He let me go clear my head for lunch."

"What do you do?"  I asked as I set the plate with the sandwich in front of Sage with the hummus, crackers and raw vegetables in the middle of the bar.  I carried my plate as I listened to him.

I had to walk past him to get to the empty seat and caught the scent of lavender and jasmine.  That was the scent I couldn't place the other night - jasmine.  I sat down in the bar stool and looked over at Sage who was smiling at me.

"I'm a security consultant.  But honestly, I make my money hacking into other company's computer systems to prevent the bad ones from getting in.  We then offer them fixes and help combat the black hat hackers. What do you do?"

I grinned at him as I bit into my sandwich to delay the half truth I was about to tell him.  But I didn't want to start off this relationship with a lie, he would never believe the truth, anyway.  "Technically, I'm a law enforcement officer.  We call them hunters since that's what we do.  I hunt monsters for a living.  Though I wouldn't classify them as monsters."

Sage laughed.  "Fine don't tell me."

I shrugged.  "No honestly, I do.  My job is to protect humanity from the things that go bump in the night."  I knew he wouldn't believe me so I did the one thing that could get me hunted - I showed Sage what I could do.  I held the palm of my hand up above the bar and watched as the pattern of a single flickering flame formed above it. 

Sage's eyes grew big, and he backed off the stool and fell to the floor.  I sighed and dropped my hand and the flame winked out.  Instead of getting up Sage laid on the ground staring at the ceiling.  He didn't look at me as he asked, "What was that?"  He leaned up on his elbows and looked up at me towering over him in the bar stool eating the rest of my sandwich.  "And so what are you?"

"I'm half human.  Half Venatori." I could get into a history lesson but that didn't exactly feel first date like - was this even a first date?

"So you all can do magic like that?"  Sage was sitting cross legged on the floor staring up at me.  I didn't like it but I didn't dare get closer.

"No, we can't all do magic like I can.  Few can do magic like me.  The Venatori are faster, and stronger than humans, we can react faster and think faster.  We can heal faster.  We have special mental abilities - things like empathy, reading minds, photographic memories which help us hunt the other species who go rogue. All to protect humanity.  I'm Magnus, we have the ability to bend the elements.  But most Magnus can only bend one element at a time.  Sometimes we can bend more than one element, but never at the same time.  Except Cesari, which is what I am."  I wove four different balls in front of me and juggled them.  "I can bend, fire, earth, water and air all at the same time."

"And because I told you what I am, and revealed the Clandestine Providence to you I am now considered a rogue element and if anyone finds out they will come and hunt me down, and kill you too."

Sage laughed, "All because you didn't want to lie to a guy you liked?   Why would you do that?"

"You already said it.  I like you.  I didn't think starting off with a lie I would have to keep perpetrating would work for long if you kept weaseling your way into my life with ease."  I sighed and pushed my empty plate away as Sage sat down again in the bar stood he'd vacated.

"What lie would you have told me if I was not some guy you liked?"  He was grinning at me before he took a bite of his own sandwich.

"I'd have said I was a security consultant of the physical type - a body guard so to speak."

Sage smiled.  "We'll go with that if anyone asks."  Sage placed his hand on my knee and squeezed it before returning it to hold his sandwich, "I became a white hat hacker when I was young because I got caught hacking into the Pentagon computer system.  They couldn't try me as an adult so they trained me and let me continue to hit the normal circuits so I'd stay on top of things.  They give me leeway to hack systems in my free time as long as I tell my boss the results and then I help them patch up their holes.  I have a contract with them for the next 20 years or so, to pay for my crimes as a child."

I grinned at him, "Are you sharing dark secrets to make me feel better about telling you something I shouldn't?"

Sage nodded his mouth full of the last bite of his sandwich.  I watched as he swallowed and my body tightened.  Sage smiled. "That was a good sandwich.  I'm sorry I freaked out over the magic thing.  I thought you were joking - that this wasn't serious to you.  Your reputation precedes you."

"I'm sorry you know more about me than I know about you."  I truly was, there was no telling what else he knew about me.  He was friends with one girl I slept with, there was no telling how many others he might know.

Sage crunched into a celery stick slathered with humus and he tilted his head to the side.  "Interesting anyway.  I've never had humus before."

I smiled.  "New horizons for both of us it seems."

Sage stood up and leaned against my leg that was closest to him.  One arm was on the back of my bar stool the other was resting on the counter.  He had me much trapped between him and the wall.  I had room to move if I wanted to, but I didn't.

I looked up at him, towering over me in the bar stool and his six foot plus height.  It made me swallow hard looking up at him looking down on me with something very near lust filled eyes.  I wondered how I was looking up at him.  I knew what my body was feeling, and I wasn't great at hiding what I wanted.  And I wanted him in this moment.  

He leaned down and whispered in my ear, "I like making you bite your bottom lip."  Sage walked away and deeper into my apartment.  It was composed of one room and the separate bathroom.  I rated that at least.  But I had also renovated it to get the kitchen and bathroom I wanted.  

Sage stopped in the open space between the couch and my bed and then turned around.  "I like your apartment.  Everything right where you need it.  You don't spend a lot of time here do you?"

"I do. Actually.  Everything is just in its place.  You'll notice the dust on the tops of things and the dust bunnies that live in the corners.  I'm not a neat freak, but things need to be put away or I get antsy."  I smiled as I sat facing him in the bar stool.

He was smiling while I spoke and looked like he was listening to every word I said.  He must have practice listening to his girl friends.  He clearly had them.  "How many people get to see where you live?"

The smile on Sage's face and bright sapphire eyes made my mouth go dry and I sipped at my own remaining coffee before I answered him, "You would be the first."

"There was a guy here before?"  The playfulness in his voice was apparent, but I wondered how much he was hiding.

"Dorian? He's my friend, my guide when I was younger. He was checking up on me since he's still technically my guardian."

"So he's like your father?" Sage asked taking a few steps closer.

"Yes, and no.  He didn't raise me.  His name is attached to mine when the Academy required signatures of parents.  Since I had none, he was one of two people who could sign for me that were not my teachers."  

"Who's the second?"

I smiled but looked down as I answered, "My therapist.  We've been speaking since I was six years old.  Dorian has been with me since I was five."

"You have a therapist since you were six?"  Sage laughed, "So you are pretty messed up then?"

I frowned at him.  My heart beat faster in my chest and my palms were sweating.  I didn't look back up.  I felt the rejection in the air, I knew what would happen when I confessed.  I could lie, but I didn't want to.  "I am."

Sage closed the distance between us, I could feel his nearness and see his canvas Converse underneath me.  He wasn't touching me, almost like he was afraid of me.  He spoke to me with one hand on the back of my chair just touching me and the other on the counter.  "I bounced around from foster home to foster home after my parents died until Danny and Rosella took me in.  They are the only family I know. I had an older brother, but we were separated.  I was a problem child and the family that took them didn't want to keep me because of it."

I looked up and saw sadness in Sage's eyes and I didn't want them to be sad.  I gave him a sideways grin before grabbing his t-shirt by the Captain America shield and pulled him in to kiss.

Sage halted his downward progress just short of actually kissing me.  I opened my eyes and his eyes were right there smiling back at me.  I leaned back so I could look at him with a frown.  Sage ran his fingers over my bottom lip, "Not yet."

A shiver ran through my body at the touch and I sighed, but I nodded as I closed my eyes, savoring it.  Sage chuckled in the darkness of my closed lids.  I felt his breath against my skin as he leaned down and whispered into my ear, "I'm glad you react so easily."

I laughed.  "You are so playing me."

Sage kissed my check, "I'm not playing with you to be mean.  But I will make sure you want more than just sex before I give you what you want?"

I opened my eyes and looked at him.  He was so close I bit my bottom lip and let it go as I spoke in hushed tones  "What do I want?"

Sage grinned, "Me, of course."

I laughed. "Yeah, I can't deny that."

Sage took a step away from me and move towards the door.  "I need to get back to work," he said with sadness in his voice.  

"I don't have to get back to work until late this evening.  I suppose I can find someone else to entertain me when you go."

Sage laughed.  "What are you doing tonight that requires you to work?"

I grinned at him, "I have to go to a bar with Walker so we can ask about a dragon who's been robbing banks and revealing herself to the humans."

"A dragon?  Like a fire breathing, scales and all that?"  Sage grinned. "She can't be too hard to find.  I mean aren't dragons big?"

"Dragon's can shift into human form.  And they can still breathe fire while in it, so it's not as easy as you made it sound."  I laughed.

"Well, as long as you don't hook up with some lowlife bar crawler while you are out I won't get jealous you are going out without me."  Sage teased.

"I have no intentions of hooking up.  I'll send you a text of my bed when I get home just to prove it to you."

Sage laughed, "But you don't bring your friends home - remember?"

"Okay."  I smiled. "Stay here a moment."  I went into my bathroom and pulled out the brown paper bag that housed my box of protection and crumpled the top and walked out with it.  "Here."  I handed Sage the bag.  I waited until he opened the bag and looked inside and he grinned.  When he looked back up with those perfect blue eyes I melted at the dark lustful look in them.  "I won't be sleeping with anyone until you give me that back or tell me to fuck off, which ever comes first."

Sage laughed and crumpled the top of the paper bag and leaned forward and pressed a light kiss to my lips.  He pulled away with a smile, "That deserved something special."  I was still licking my lips where his lips pressed against mine.  I opened my eyes feeling the pressure of my teeth biting into my lip again.  He chuckled, "I will see you around, Nox.  I still want that text with you in the picture of your bed."

My breath caught as he opened the door to the hallway and smiled at me.  I nodded unable to speak still.  Sage laughed again.  "Later, Nox."

The door closed, and I stood there straining to hear his footsteps leaving.  I listened until I could hear them no more.

The rest of my afternoon would be such a downer.



# Dragon Hunting

I had been right, the rest of my afternoon was boring.  I sent Sage a text with an image of my dinner - steak and roasted sweet potatoes in olive oil and a little cinnamon and sugar and a small side salad with raspberry vinaigrette.

I was still running on the flames of the text and the memory of his lips against mine when I got dressed to go out. I decided I would not make Walker throat?uncomfortable so I play it down.  The upside, I would not get the shit kicked out of me at a potential biker bar.

I still work a thick swath of black eyeliner and my hair and nails were still matching sapphire blue from the night before.  But I wore black jeans that weren't too tight because I might end up running later in the evening if things went wrong.  I pulled on a plain white t-shirt under a white button up, which I didn't button up.  I didn't spike my hair after my shower; I let the blue tips fall over the right side and cover more of my Venatori tattoo on my right temple.  

The crossed swords were a dead give away to who we were.. It was a good thing only supernatural creatures could see them.

I sent Sage another text with a selfie in the mirror.

I grinned as I walked out the door with my phone and my keys.  My id and some cash were in my front pocket.  I brought nothing else when I went out - except two foil packs, but Sage had my stash and I really wasn't going to hook up.  It was ensurea work thing.

I took the stairs down to the lobby where I told Walker I would meet him. I looked around but Walker was no where to be seen, despite the fact I was through,sure I was late. I didn't check the time while I waited near the statue I'd made when I was ten.  They called it Atlas.  I hadn't called it anything.  It was a statue of a man holding a glass orb with a tiny living garden inside it.

I had used all four elements at the same time to create that statue, the seeds for the grass growing inside the glass orb was the only thing I hadn't created.  Dae'lin had itsimpressed as had everyone else in the Academy.  

Dorian had retested me in all the elements and I passed with flying colors. They rated me as an AC5 at 10 years old, the youngest Magnus to receive such a rating.

Walker walked towards me looking up at the statue behind me.  "I still can't believe you did that when you were just a kid."

I laughed.  "I can't believe it's still here."

Walker walked towards the lobby exit.  "Why not?"

I shrugged.  "I figure someone would be tired of it.  It's been here for 13 years."

"Like shit changes around here." Walker said as we headed down the street towards the subway station. 

I knew Walker was hard core in the Venatori.  There was little in the way of change in our species.  We'd spent the last few centuries stagnant in our beliefs.  We had changed with the times in terms of technology, but that had a lot more to do with the ease of information in the human world.  And all us young folks taking to it as we integrated into human society.  

My father for instance, never used a computer, but he had a cell phone.  We'd shared a text or two over the past several years but not many.  Nick and I talked more than me and my father did.  But then Nick was three months my junior.  We'd been acquaintances when we were in school.  Now Nick was a Scrin.  He worked in the Academy teaching kids how to use computers.  He was a tech geek, he always had been.  

Walker and I got on the train and we rode two stops before getting off.  In reality we could have walked just as fast.  But it gave us a chance to just relax before having to pay complete attention to our surroundings.  Not that Walker or I relaxed, we'd both been hunting just long enough that everything made us paranoid.

The Ugly Dog Saloon was a hole in the wall bar in between several other bars.  There were no Harley's or other bikes sitting outside the bar, there wasn't any parking on the streets most of the time.  And tonight was a street cleaning night so the cars would get towed and fined, always a pain in the ass for car owners.  For which I was grateful I was not.  

I knew how to drive but I didn't need to drive anywhere in the City.  When I needed to go to Jace's I would just take the subway and catch a cab or walk depending on the weather.  Jace owned one vehicle, but he drove back and forth everyday.

The door jingled when I opened it and let Walker in first.  He chuckled as he walked inside and found a table in the corner that was empty.  We had the eyes of everyone when we walked in, but no one said anything or moved, they sat in place and watched as we moved to a table in the corner.

I followed Walker and sat down opposite him, my back was to the room, which was all right for the moment.  Walker nodded towards the bar.  "You want a pitcher or bottles?"

"Bottle."  I said, and I turned my chair to sit more towards the wall as Walker got up to get us beers.

I scanned the room and let my vision see everything.  It was like turning on and off a light for me - turning off the patterns around us everyday.  The room swam in my vision as I took in everything at once.  I had to blink my eyes several times to clear the tears that had formed.

Walker sat down, "I wasn't gone that long, damn man.  Get a grip."  He grinned at me with a snide smile.

I grinned at him, "Everyone in here is supernatural and I mean everyone."

Every supernatural creature had a distinct pattern about them.  Dragons and therians - shape shifters who have the lycanthropy virus or more commonly called werecreatures - werewolves.  Even humans had a pattern around them, but it was dim.  The stronger it was the more sensitive to the Clandestine Providence they were - and they usually had human magic - they were called Paths.  I didn't know many paths, but I had met a few here in the City.

The wolves and the vampires ruled the City, but now there were dragons in their territory.  It hadn't started a turf war yet, but it was bittenlikely to happen soon if the dragons were this far in number in just the Ugly Dog Saloon.

I could see so many shadows of dragons in the patrons and the staff.  There were a few wolves who were drinking in a small group in the opposite corner as us.  There was a vampire in the corner farthest from the door.  But I wasn't sure if anyone else saw him in the shadows.  I saw him though.  It was hard to hide in the shadows when you could see the glowing patterns around a person.

I blinked my eyes and turned my extra senses off and then smiled at Walker.  "We have three wolves in the corner opposite us, and one vampire in the corner table farthest from the door.  Everyone else is a dragon."

The door jingled as another patron walked in.  I blinked as I saw a beautiful woman with ebony skin and golden hair with orange eyes walking towards the bar.  Her hair was not golden like human hair was golden, no this was like gold - as in the metal - strands hung from her head.  But I recognized her dragon form.  I nodded towards the woman and smiled at Walker.  "That's her."

"How can you tell?"

I smiled.  "She couldn't hide her dragon from me.  I wish I could see it for real.  The color of her hair and her eyes and the color of her skin I bet she's a gorgeous dragon."

Walker looked at me.  But he asked, "So Mr. Seasoned Hunter, what should we do?"

"Let's go talk to her." I said as I stood up.  Walker didn't follow me or at least I didn't feel him at my back.  But I didn't look back as I approached the bar and sat on the stool next to her.  There were a lot of eyes on me as I moved through the place.  Since everyone here was supernatural seeing my tattoo was a given, but I probably smelled very much like Venatori despite being only half.

The beautiful exotic woman looked at me with a straight face.  "There are plenty of other seats."

"I know." I replied.  

She looked to the bartender and then back to me and I turned to face her with what I hoped was a disarming smile.  Her eyes went wide as she saw the black ink below the orange tips that did not hide much of the tattoo at my right temple.  She gasped, "Venatori."

Her eyes blinked sideways like a reptile's would.  She was losing control of her humanness, but maybe with those eyes and that hair she didn't try to be more human.  "Ferrasss."  She lept backwards and darted through the door behind the bar.

The bartender stood in front of the opening staring at me.  "I only said I know."

"Why are you after her?"

I sighed.  "Derek right? Your father used to own this joint." I nodded knowing it was the truth.  "She used fire breath in front of humans."

He hung his head and stepped aside.  "Don't kill her.  We know who you are, please don't.  She has a son."

"You know who I am?  Or what I am?"

The man down the end of the bar spoke for the bartender, "You are the boy Venatori who would rather take us in.  But any you catch never actually come back out."  He stood up and walked towards me.  His right hand strayed over his waist which usually meant they had a gun.  I wondered where Walker was in that moment.  But I had my own problems to deal with and couldn't look for the man I had come here to help.

"I don't want to kill her.  Hell, I  don't care that she was robbing banks.  The humans can't contain her if they catch her."

"They won't catch her," the bartender said with a gruff grumble.

I frowned, "If I found her here, they will too.  Humans aren't idiots no matter what you might think.  They don't believe in things like magic."  The image of Sage falling out of his bar stool came to mind.  I had frightened him.  But it was what I am - who I am.  

"If I can bring her in, I can try to help her, and her son.  But if my friend finds her, she will be dead."  I knew this would go down bad if I didn't get out of here soon.

There were guns all around me.  And dragons that could breathe fire that was more terrifying that the guns.  I'd been burnt once with dragon fire - from a human form dragon none-the-less.  Who would have thought a dragon could still spew hot napalm like fire at you from a human throat?  I learned that the hard way, and I bore a mangled scar on my left leg from the encounter.  If I'd not been Cesari, I couldn't have put that fire out and I would have burned to death.  Dragon's fire was dangerous to confront and so many of it one place, all aimed at me.

"I don't want to fight you.  I want to find her.  She has to be stopped or she'll give us all away.  You know we can't have that.  The humans aren't ready for dragons, and vampires and werewolves living among them, not to mention all the other scary things that go bump in the night we keep from them.  Just let me go."

The bartender nodded.  I returned the nod and backed up the way the woman dragon had fled.  "You can go.  Don't kill her Feras.  We are trusting you."

"I can't guarantee that.  If she attacks me I will defend myself."

"We know."  The vampire in the corner spoke.  "The Last Phoenix is on our ground, they will let you do your job."

One wolf in the corner stood up.  "The CCB will ensure that the Last Phoenix doesn't retaliate against you Venatori.  Not the whole of your kind, you."

"Thank you."  I gave them both a bow.  They weren't alpha's in their own right, but they would speak to them.  And it was helpful that they knew who I was.  Because I knew people in high places among the vampires and the werewolves.

Once my back was to the opening she had gone through, I turned an looked through, it was the kitchen and there was a door in the back.  I couldn't track her the human way in the City, I needed to use my otherworldly skills and maybe get help from the local police to find where she went.  But the latter was risky for the police and myself.  But we'd do what we had to do.

The back rooms were hot from the nearby kitchen.  I opened my senses and I could smell everything under the sun.  The aroma's from the kitchen alone were over powering, the hot-sauce and garlic were the predominant smells and I needed to leave before I sneezed.

Outside in the alleyway up the stretch near the street entrance stood Walker pacing back and forth.  He saw me and yelled down the alley, "Where the fuck have you been?  She came out way before you.  Did you let her get away?"

"Her friends inside detained me.  I talked my way out, otherwise it would have been a fight."  I grimaced as the smell of putrid garbage wafted my direction.  But I also caught the scent of smoke lingering in the air.  I walked in that direction, , andit was the same way Walker had run, which meant I , andhad our dragon's scent.

Dragon's smelled like smoke - like a forest fire.  But some of them smelled like volcanic smoke filled with ash, you almost wanted to brush your nose from the feeling of the ash all around you.  

I walked past the entrance to the alley and turned left following the scent of the dragon.  Walker fell in step behind me.  "What are you doing?"

"Tracking her."

"How?  There is nothing to track."

"In the City you can't use foot prints you have to use your other senses.  Smell is usually the best one.  Didn't they teach you that?"  I asked out of curiosity.  They hadn't taught me that, I'd picked it up working the streets.  I knew it was something you learned working in the field.  Something they wanted you to figure out.

"No.  I wouldn't even know where to begin, I can't pick out any one scent much less know what a dragon smells like."

"You really are new to hunting in the city aren't you?" 

Walker nodded.  "So tell me what I should be looking for or smelling for in this case?"

I didn't like teaching him because he was a Venatori snob.  What I taught him now could use against innocent supernaturals.  But I sighed and spoke as I turned left down another street.  "Dragon's smell like smoke.  Each kind having their own distinct flavor, but each dragon has their own scent too.  The trick is picking out the different ones."

Walker didn't look like he was trying to track anything, which was for the better right now.  But he asked more intrigued than before, "What do other's smell like?"

"Vampires smell like death.  All new vamps have strong death smells, the older they get the less they do.  I've met an 800 plus vampire who could cover his smell with cologne.  He liked to wear Polo Sport.  Said it was all the rage at home."

"What happened to the vamp?"  Walker asked.

"He bit me and I had to kill him."

"But you were having a conversation with him before that?"

I shook my head with a smirk, "No.  I'd tracked him to a club, and I hit on him to get him outside to kick my ass.  He informed of that me when I told him he smelled good.  And when I continued to hit on him he did want to kick my ass, which I obliged him with by asking him to take it outside with me."  I sighed.  "He got the jump on me, bit a chuck out of my arm and laughed before I took his head off with a razor sharp wire of fire and air.  He fell to the ground in a heap, there wasn't even a drop of blood spilled.  An easy clean up."

Walker frowned.  "Why aren't you dead?"

I smiled.  "I'm not full Venatori.  I guess that's a plus.  Venom from the Vampire bite didn't kill me."

"Have you been bitten by a Therian?"  Walker asked as the scent moved, and it was mingling with other dragon scents.  I had to concentrate a little hard to find the right one.  

I stopped in the middle of the sidewalk and turned with a frown.  "She's up there somewhere."

Walker and I looked up trying to glimpse our dragon against the night sky.  I could illuminate the whole block but that would give me away to her and to the humans around me.  That wouldn't be a good idea I had already been pushing it with telling Sage.  It was best not to push our boundaries.

Walker asked, "Dragons can fly right?  But not in human form?"

I shrugged, "I've never seen one fly in human form, but there is a first time for everything.  Why?"

Walker nodded towards the fire escape, "That's the only one down.  If you think she went up, I think it's the best lead we have right now if she's not shifting into dragon form, which I don't think she did, or we'd have a panicked mass of people here."

"I agree.  Let's go up then." 
We headed for the fire escape and Walker climbed.  I took a deep breath and pushed aside my growing fear and went up myself.

Walker looked down and smiled, "I guess you were right, you don't let things get in your way."

"I conquer my fears, they don't conquer me."  I whispered, but I could hear the fear making my works shake.  But I don't think Walker noticed at least he said nothing.  

We climbed up the fire escape but as we passed a cracked window, I caught her scent again.  "Here," I said and stopped to open the window.  

It was breaking and entering.  We could go to jail if we got caught in the act.  I looked around and saw no one in the immediate vicinity and I drew a veil around us and the fire escape.  It reflected the world back upon itself without me and Walker moving inside of it.  It was invisibility so to speak, but it was just a trick of the eye.  If someone wanted to see us, they could, but a camera's lens would not be fooled.

Walker opened the window and stepped inside first.  There was a sharp scream and then a high hysterical crying sound coming from the room.  Walker was pointing a gun at a man wearing a black leather jacket with the Last Phoenix sewn on.  He was holding a small baby boy as ebony black as the woman and the same golden hair only much shorter in curls.  His orange eyes were drawn to me when I stepped into the room.

"We need to know where she is." I said.  Walker stepped closer with the gun still pointed at them.

The man pulled his son closer, and the boy whimpered and cried.  It alternated between fear and something else.  He shouted at us, "I know what you are.  Naomi said not to tell you anything.  We were safe from you."

I sighed.  "No.  I'm afraid you are not safe from us.  Your son is guilt free and can live a normal life.  You robbed a bank. We will give you over to the human police to be tried in your Naomi's stead.  You can let the world know dragon's exist as a plea for insanity.  No one will believe you.  Tell us where she went.  We know she came here."

The man was human, which made the child a half dragon.  I'd never seen or heard of a surviving half dragon.  I knelt down and looked into the boy's eyes and smiled.  "Your son is special."

He pulled the boy farther from me.  "Get out Feras.  We want nothing to do with you."

"You try very hard to be a dragon don't you?  But you fail.  It's why they won't let you put the mark on your skin.  You are not a dragon."  I had many questions, many things in the supernatural world were changing, were the dragons allowing half human children to survive, and humans among their ranks?  There was a lot to figure out. A war waiting to happen.  There always was in the world humans knew nothing about.

A rock fell down the metal fire escape.  She wanted us away from her family.  "She's baiting us."

I wove weaves of air around the man and the boy.  "You need to stay here.  I'll be back after we got her."

"Don't kill her!" the man pleaded.  

"We'll try not to."

I went out first, I think because I was closer, but I had other reasons to go first.  I was Magnus, I was Cesari, I had the better advantage this time.

We climbed the rest of the fire escape and found Naomi on the roof half in dragon form, half out.  Her body was lined obsidian like scales intermingled with gold ones.  Her large orange eyes were above a reptilian snout.  I'd never seen a half form before.  

Walker had his gun trained on her but she was staring at me.  Her mouth opened and let out a long threatening growl.  I took a step back and wove a wall of air between us.  I'd been burned once too many, and I wasn't about to become fricasseed again.

Naomi spoke in guttural tones of a throat unused to human speech, "Youu.  Will. Not. Take me."  She growled again, and I felt the vibrations through my body.  "The Dragon.  Will.  Never. Die!"  And with the last words she spat out fire from her mouth and a single shot rang out.  I assumed it was Walker's gun going off, but it didn't matter as I lunged for Walker and wove shield of air around us both.  

The flaming breath coiled around the bubble of air and Walker stared at it in amazement as it died down.  His shot had been true, Naomi had only stopped her fire breath because she could no longer breathe.  Her lungs were filling up with blood.  

A gun shot wound would not have made it past a dragon's scales, but it looked like half human scales weren't as strong.

I walked over to her and Walker followed his gun trained on her.  "What does The Dragon want to do?"

She spat at me.  Blood and spittal landed not to far from my foot.

Walker kicked her, "Who's this Dragon?"

I sighed.  "Stop Walker.  The Dragon is an ancient dragon his birth name was Ye Pan.  He runs the Last Phoenix.  He was and always has been a big name in the City.  Though he's never involved himself with robbing banks before."

I looked at Naomi, "I'll keep your son safe.  What does the Dragon want?"

"Humanity will die!"  She growled at me again and snapped.  I sighed and wrapped her mouth and her body in bands of air.

"It looks like a long night."  If there was a conspiracy going down, it was something the Venatori needed to hear, and The Dragon was not some little name to ignore.  I could only hope they saw it the way I did.



# Conspiracy

I didn't want Walker alone with any of the dragons or the human.  He might off and pop them because he could.  But the humans needed a scapegoat, and this man would provide one.  And the boy, I didn't want him to get hurt; he was only a kid.

"We are really going to question her?"  Walker asked.

"You heard her, there is something more going on.  We need to understand."  I shrugged.  

"Normally, I'd just call a cleanup crew," he added.

I smiled.  "We can walk them right in the back door."  I wove a platform of air and tied her arms and legs to it with more air and she floated with us as we climbed down the fire escape ladders to the living apartment again.

The man and the boy walked in front of Walker and I lead with the floating tied dragon behind me.  But no one saw us.  The veil was thick around us, people saw what they expected to see.  It was a good trick.  Some vampires had a similar ability.  I had only met one who could do it well, but there were rumors that Il Cane could hid in plain sight of any Venatori and no one would ever find her.  She was meant to scare you, her powers were godlike for a reason - she was the singular forced that kept the vampires in line.  Their council sent her after the big bad vampires.  She did what we did for all the races.  And I had hunted her once.

It was a good memory.  Every new Venatori out in the field is given a list of names to hunt and kill with a mentor beside them.  And every new hunter gets one name - Il Cane or more importantly her real name - Cari Giovanni.  

It's a trick test to see how many people take forever to figure out who she is and that it was a test.  Most people fail it.  They either try to hunt her down and fail, or they fail to recognize who she is and their mentors just out right tell them.

I fell into both categories.  I hunted Il Cane, however I knew who I was hunting.  When Michaela told me to give it up I did, but once I completed my first assignments, I hunted her.  It was a test of my skill.

Between my cases, I tracked Il Cane to Florida, where she keeps a large estate.  One to which I've been on.

I didn't find her, but I found her son.  Figlio del Cane, Ant Giovanni, was legendary in and of himself, the only born vampire who couldn't walk in daylight.  He stalled me and told me to stop hunting his mother.  She had sent him to let me know I had done better than any other hunter - in her life time.  It was high praise.  Ant and I hung out for a few weeks comparing notes on our jobs and we worked together whenever I had a vampire case.  

It was a good memory, and it had taken me all the way home with little incident.  Walker had said nothing to pull me out of my memories while we returned to the Apex Unlimited Building.  The back doors shielded Â Venatori guards on the inside from view. They shook their heads as they saw me and my now human dragon behind me.  She'd thought to escape my bonds of air with the shift. Â When that failed she moaned in subjecation. Â I wasn't an idiot, the bonds reacted to all her movements - never too tight, never too loose..

Walker and I lead the three dragon conspirators upstairs to HQ.  We took the elevator - it was faster than taking the 20 plus floors and I wasn't sure the human man would make it.

I knew we ascended in the service elevator, but my heart didn't race when I didn't see the floor getting smaller below us.

My phone blipped a text from an unknown number and I smiled as the doors opened.  I'd have to take a look at it later, when I didn't have a dragon to contend with.

Dae'lin and Gary greeted us - the two heads of the field hunting office.  Gary had a frown on his face, and Dae'lin remained neutral, she was used to my presents.

"Why are you bringing us three detainees?"  Gary asked.  His voice sounded sleepy.  I was glad someone woke him up.  It was already a long night for us.  Let someone else join in on our misery.

"This isÂ the dragon who we caught on camera that Walker's been tracking down. She attacked us, Walker shot her, I'd have let him finish her, but she mentioned The Dragon and humanity dying.  She won't speak to us.  At least not before she dies.  She needs help.  I've done what I can to ease her pain and clear her breathing but she'll die and she had important information."

Gary asked, "Why the human and the boy?"  Walker had the same question in his eyes but he hadn't asked it before.  A show of solidarity with the detainees.  It was noble of him.

"The humans need to catch someone for the bank robberies.  He's your man.  Spin the story he's the mastermind.  Plant the evidence - the usual and you satisfy the cops.  The boy is just that, a boy.  I couldn't leave him in the house alone."

Gary was fuming now, there was a pulsing in the vein in his neck that made me think of drinking blood.  A vampire would very much like this state of Gary.  "What the fuck am I supposed to do with a dragon boy?"

"Put him in with the toddlers until the dragons can come get him."

Naomi squirmed and thrashing in her bonds at what I'd said.  The human man cried out, "They'll kill him."

I smiled.  "If you cooperate, then I'm sure we can work something out to save your son."

Gary frowned and pushed me back in the elevator.  "Dae'lin take the bonds.  He's making offers no one can keep.  Get now!  Walker come with us.  Explain things."

Walker nodded, "Yes, sir."

Dae'lin gave me a smile.  "Enjoy your birthday, Nox."

I frowned at her as I walked out of the elevator and headed towards the stairs to go back to my room.

I took my phone out and open the text Sage had sent me earlier  when I ran into someone.  I apologized and moved without ever looking up, but the man stepped into my way and I looked up.

When I saw who I'd run into, I took a step backwards.Â I hated that smile on his face.  He spoke with feigned happiness, "Well, hello, Nox."

"Garrett." I said as I felt the fear rise inside.

He laughed.  "What are you doing up at this hour?"

"I was working."  I blurted. The need to be elsewhere grew inside.  I could feel my heart racing and I knew I was sweating, I could feel my shirt clinging to my skin.

"A case kept you out?  Not your birthday?"  He asked like he was interested in the answer.

"Yeah.  We were scouting out a known location - a bar - of a target."  

"You weren't seeing your blue-eyed friend?"  Garrett asked.

How the fuck did he know about Sage?  Did he see him coming or going from my apartment?  I frowned.  "I wasn't with my friend.  I was with Walker Moore.  He couldn't find a dragon.  I was helping him."

"Walker Moore?"  He nodded as if he understood, "I didn't think you worked with anyone."

"I don't.  Dae'lin assigned me."  I moved to the side, "I'm tired.  I want to go now."

He smiled at me.  I winched as he put his hand on my shoulder.  I saw the laughter in his eyes but he never did more than touch me.  He was trying to scare me.  "By all means.  Sleep."  I didn't like that smile on his face.

I nodded my head and pulled away from his grip.  "Good night, Garrett."  I hurried into the stairwell and took the stairs three at a time until I reached my floor.  But once up there I stopped and leaned against the wall and slide down with my knees against my chest and my head tucked between my knees.  Why did he always make me feel like I was five again?  I closed my eyes for a few moments.

My phone buzzed again, and I pulled it out of my pocket and glanced at the time.  What the fuck, it was 4 am already?  I didn't remember falling asleep but I must have.  It wasn't that late when we got back. 

I glanced at the reason my phone had disturbed me and I saw a second message from Sage.

I sighed. Three hours of time lost in the stair well.  I had to look like shit, my body ached and my butt was numb from sitting on the cold concrete floor of the stair well.

I didn't get an immediate reply, so I got up and opened the door to the hall and headed for my apartment.  My phone buzzed that annoying I don't know who you are text as I unlocked the door.  I looked at it once I got inside and shut the door behind me. I got up and opened the door to the hall and headed for my apartment.

I removed the white over shirt and tossed it into the hamper and removed my jeans and shoes and flopped down on my bed while I waited for Sage to text back.  Maybe he had fallen asleep.

I held up the phone above me and took another selfie as promised.  My bed.  It was 4 am, and I was just going to bed.  I hadn't done this in years.

I sent the selfie to Sage.

I crawled under my orange comforter and the peach sheet underneath and curled around a pillow not expecting to hear my phone ring.  I answered it without thinking.

"Hey."

Sage answered back, "Hey. I'm sorry you had a shitty night.  Can I make your day any better?"

Sage couldn't see my drowsy smile. "Maybe after a few hours of sleep."  It was my birthday after all and I had nothing else planned except more work.

"Do you want to stop by?  We can get a biteÂ to eat...  Nox?"

I startled.  "I'm here.  Sorry, in that post panic state, I'm drained.  I'll call you when I wake up, all right?  We can do something."

Sage breathed a sigh of relief.  "All right.  Call me.  Good night, Nox."

I smiled, and I wished I could see those beautiful blue eyes in front of me, "Night, Sage."  The phone went dead, and I curled around the pillow again with the phone tucked under it in my hand like it was the only thing holding me to the mysterious blue-eyed boy.

I dreamt of him.  And  then the blue eyes instead of the red floated towards me.  The flashes of fire and earth across my skin.  The blue eyes startling me awake when they didn't reveal the face I expected.

I woke with my heart in my throat, my bed was soaking wet from sweat.  My t-shirt and boxers clung to my skin and there was a pounding on my apartment door.  Or maybe that was my head.

I clutched my phone in my hand and there was new text.

I was not awake, but I went to the door and opened it to find Sage standing outside with two cups of hot coffee from a shopÂ downstairs and that gorgeous smile.Â Â 
I looked at my phone then back up at Sage still not comprehending what happened. The vestages of my last dream lingered and everything was a blur.

I moved aside and took the coffee Sage offered me.  His smile faded when he looked at me.  "A little bird told me it was your birthday today. She saidÂ to come by in four hours.  Is this all right?"

I nodded and sipped the cup.  It was warm and smelled wonderful.  I hadn't realized the coffee downstairs was so good.  "You look worse than before." Sage whispered.

I sat down on my bed and fished out my notebook under the pillow and took it to the bar and sat down.  "Was woken by a nightmare."

Sage sat down next to me and watched as I pulled the pencil from the spiral bindings and opened to the last page.  I sketched the new image from my dream.  It wasn't much different, only the color was different, everything else had been the same.

When the image was complete, I went to the bedside stand and fished out the blue pencils and colored the eyes in their new shade. I went to the bedside stand and fished out the blue pencils and colored the eyes in their new shade.

Sage was frowning at the drawing when I put the last pencil down.  "All the others are red?"

I nodded.  I was still processing it.  "I was thinking about you when I fell asleep."

Sage touched the notebook, "May I?"  He looked at me, the fear in his eyes was apparent.  

I nodded.  

He pulled it close and flipped a few pages back, and then more, and then to the beginning.  "The same dream every night?"

"It varies some, but yeah."

"Jesus, Nox.  Does anyone know?"

"Everyone does.  I've been sketching them since I was 6."

"Everything aside, they are pretty good."  Sage smiled at me and put his hand on mine and squeezed.  "Can I help?"

I smiled. "You already have."  I held up the cup of coffee and ran my finger down the side of his clean shaven jawline.  A visible shiver ran down his body and I grinned at his reaction which made me bite my bottom lip.

Sage chuckled.  "So what do you want to do today?  Mia texted me and said no one would make you work on your birthday.  Something about rules."

"More like tradition.  But the rest of the day is mine." I laughed to myself, when Sage gave me the cockeyed puppy dog look I answered the unspoken question, "I'm surprised Mia is pushing so hard.  She is very big on me marrying and starting a family.  Always asking when I'll find Mrs. Right and settle down."

Sage smiled.  "Go get a shower and I'll take you out for breakfast."

I nodded with a grin.  "All right."

I took a quick shower.  Or what I thought was quick anyway.  I hadn't considered that it might be 30 minutes under the water,Â I had zoned out a little under the hot stream against my skin. The hot water stung the fresh scars on my back.  They had healed as they had formed but they were tender under the heat and pressure.

I wiped the mirror down and looked at my back in the mirror and saw two new pink welts, they didn't look like they'd broken the skin, which was why there had been no blood.  That they were still tender meant it was strikes in the same place.  I pulled all the elements around me and pressed them like a cold compress to the welts in my back and I watched as the tender redness faded.  It healing faster than normal.

Magnus couldn't heal.  Not in a traditional sense.  A human would die from wounds if I were to do the same thing to them.  I was providing the material for my body's already rapid healing, it was still doing the work.  It was the reason I had survived the vampire bite I'd told Walker about.  It was when I first realized I could do this.  I had received noÂ new scars since I'd learned that trick.

The story goes, a vamp had taken a chunk from my arm.  I was in such a rush to get to the infirmary in Boulder I hadn't thought about it.  I stuffed my wound full of the elements to keep it from bleeding and me from dying.  By the time I looked down again it was healed.  I thought it was a freak accident until I did it again with a knife wound I'd given myself in the kitchen.  until I did it again with a knife wound I'd given myself in the kitchen. 

There was a knock on the door, "You okay, Nox?"

I pulled a pair of clean boxers on and appliedÂ the swath of eyeliner.  "Yeah.  You can come in."

There would be no lies.  If he would leave me he needed to do it sooner rather than later.  I was too attached already.  I dreamt about him.  He was prying hisself into my life and I didn't want him to leave.  It was better if he left afraid of what was in store now rather than later.

Sage opened the door and in the few seconds it took to allow him entrance Sage had seen what covered my back and he was hissing in pain as the door closed behind him.  There was no one there, but he had locked it like he was hiding me from the world.  It brought a frown to my lips as I applied eyeliner to the other eye.Â 

Sage ran his fingers down my back and I froze.  He pulled his fingers away, but I didn't relax.  "Do you want to talk about it?" he asked.

"No.  But if you want to know I'll tell you."  I smiled to take some of the sting out of my words.

Sage smiled and kissed the puckered skin between my shoulder blades.  "When you are ready, I'd like to know.  Can I help?"

"Help?"  I asked.

He turned me around and took the eyeliner pencil from my hands and grinned. "Help."

I shrugged.  Sage traced the black pencil under my left eye.  

I broke the silence and told Sage the reason for the scars that made up my back.  "When I was five, I sparked - used my magic for the first time.  My mother sent me here.  My first teacher's job was to insure I was safe to be around others.  That I had complete control of my ability."  I swallowed hard and  continued to stare at the man doing my make up because I could do nothing else and finished my story in a hushed voice.  "He had to find what made me spark out of control.  When he found it he used it from a year to insure I never lost control of my ability."

"So for a year he beat you?"  Sage barked and took a step back his hands clenched at his sides.

I nodded.  "On the last day, he tried to hit me again, as one final test, before he did I sparked again.  Except it wasn't on accident.  I did it on purpose to hurt him.  When the fire alarms started fear lanced through me and I put the fire out.  But it wasn't an accident.  I was six then.  I wentÂ to the detention center for three months with mandatory therapy sessions with Dr. Silverman - Margo.  When I returned to the general population of the Academy, I had a new mentor and was to repeat my first year of fire-starter training again.  Which I was okay with.  But that's when the nightmares started.  Sometimes when they come, I hurt myself like he used to hurt me.  Margo's studied the effects of the nightmare and I am the one doing it to myself."

Sage was just staring at me when I finished.  I looked down and waited for him to walk out disgusted.  There were only two people in the world that knew my secret and neither of them would tell a soul.  I was trusting a complete stranger with my biggest and darkest secret and he was just staring at me.

Two fingers touched my chin and Sage lifted my eyes to his.  He smiled.  He finished the other eye in silence.  I couldn't bring myself to speak anymore.  

When Sage finished, he leaned forward and kissed my lips.  "Why were the eyes blue this time?"  His lips were still soÂ close to mine as he stared into my eyes.  All I could see were his beautiful eyes. 

I whispered, "I'd been thinking about you."

Sage frowned, but he pressed his lips against mine again and whispered, "I will never hurt you like that."

I grinned at him when he pulled away.  "I know.  Or rather I didn't think you would.  The fear morphed from the demon in my dream because I'm afraid of you hurting me in other ways.  It's just my fear of rejection manifesting in the only way my brain knows how to process it."

"Nox," Sage smiled, "I won't intentionally hurt you, now or in the future.  I get that you fear being dumped, we all do.  But we'll talk about everything before it ends.  Can we make that deal?"

I nodded.  "Yeah."

Sage grabbed my hand and lead me out of the bathroom door to my dresser.  "Get dressed.  Let's get breakfast.  I'm starving."

I pulled on a pair of ripped blue jeans and a dark gray t-shirt that read 'I make adorable babies'. When I turned to face Sage, he was grinning from ear to ear at my shirt.  I walked to the closet and pulled out skeleton hoodie and pulled it over my arms. 

Sage was shaking his head when I turned around, "You know it's like 75 right?"

I nodded.  "I don't like my arms or back exposed."

"You ready?" he asked.

I sat down on the bed and pulled on my Nike's and nodded.  "I am now."  Sage took my hand and entwined our fingers together.  I picked up my phone, keys and my wallet and shut the lights off and the door behind us.  This was the second date I hadn't planned in the same amount of days.

We walked through the halls hand in hand.  Sage headed for the elevator and I followed him a step behind him.  He pressed the button and then he squeezed my hand, "What's bothering you?"

I grinned.  "Is it that obvious?"

"You are trembling."

"Afraid of heights.  This elevator is the worst for my fears.  But I'll be okay."  I smiled at Sage.

The elevator doors slide open and a familiar face stood inside.  I smiled as we stepped inside.  "Hey, Dorian."  

Dorian smiled.  "Nox.  I see you have company again."

"Dorian, this is Sage Morgan."  Dorian offered his hand as I continued.  "Sage, this is Dorian Vega, my mentor."  

Sage spoke first as he took Dorian's hand.  "I've heard a lot about you."

"All good, I hope."  Dorian shook Sage's hand.

Sage laughed.  "Yeah,Â how your helped him through trying times."  Sage wrapped his arm around my waist and rubbed the small of my back and I froze.  My heart raced and my breathing increased.  I tried not to let any of it show.  Dorian's eyes went wide but Sage didn't seem to notice as he was looking at the statue in the middle of the lobby.  "Nox really make that down there?"

Dorian nodded and Sage pulled me closer when he realized I was having a panic attack.  He stopped rubbing my back and just held me against him.  IÂ smelledÂ his laundry detergent on his clothes, and the lavender and jasmine of his shampoo and bodywash. LeaningÂ against him I buried my face into his neck.  I smiled against his soft skin.  

Dorian answered, "He did.  It was spectacular.  No one believed a ten-year-old did it."  Dorian chuckled, "You handle him well."

I laughed.  "You have no idea, Dorian.  No fucking idea."

Sage kissed my cheek.  "I try."

We hit the level of the Academy and Dorian stepped off the elevator.  He turned around and held the door open as he spoke to Sage.  "You take care of him on his birthday.  Make sure he doesn't do anything stupid."

"Yes, sir."  Sage smiled against my neck.  When the door closed Sage asked, "Do you want me to stop touching your back?  I keep forgetting."

I whispered in his ear, "No."

Sage pulled me away so he could see my face. "No what?"

I smiled and gave him a soft peck on the lips, "Don't stop."

Sage grinned, and I leaned back against him and buried my face in the crook of his neck.  It was not my usual pose, it felt good having someone taller than me for once.  His hand went under my hoodie and my t-shirt to the top of my waist band and his fingers rubbed against the rough puckered skin of the slash marks that ran just below the line.  My bodied stilled and my breathing increased but I hummed into his neck encouraging him despite my bodies reaction.  Sage whispered, "You know, I don't think I've ever been with a guy who was quite so open about public displays of affection in today's world."

I hummed against his neck and bit it.  "I usually play up the gay. Though, I'mÂ not playing anything right now though."

The elevator doors opened at the lobby level and I untangled myself from Sage's body and we disembarked.  There was a small crowd waiting for the elevator but that was the extent of the people who saw us up close and personal.

Sage took my hand with a smile.  "There's a great place across the street."

I laughed.  "I don't think I've ever been there for breakfast."

Sage smiled, "It's fantastic."

We walked across the street when the lights changed down the block.  Traffic was never empty in the City, but at least we could cross without getting hit.

The door gave off that familiar little tinkle as we opened it and stepped inside the old school dinner.  The red neon letters outside in fancy script read "Bonnie's Diner".  Bonnie had owned the place for many years.  I had come here many times throughout my days in the Academy to eat and study where no one would bother me.

Bonnie looked up from reading the morning paper and blinked at us.  She smiled.  "Never thought I'd see the pair of you together.  Take a seat boys."

Sage laughed.  "You are a regular too?"

"Just not at breakfast."  I smiled as I sat down with my back to the door.

Sage nodded his head to move in. I laughed.  "If you are going to sit with me we should sit on the other side then."

Sage gave me a strange look but backed up from the table so I could get out and switch sides.  I smiled at him and took his hand to follow me in.  "I don't like my back to the door, but I was letting you have the better seat."

"Ah."  Sage grinned and squeezed my hand.  "I never understood the convention of sitting across from someone."

Bonnie came over and stood over the table. "It allows for easier and more intimate conversation.  I don't suspect either of you boys care too much for intimate conversation.  Always coming in with your books and your laptops to work."

I grinned up at her, "I like intimate conversation.  I like Sage."

She asked, "Your usual, Nox?"

I shook my head. "Not quite.  I'll take steak and eggs and whatever fresh fruit you have.  Coffee please and a glass of water."

She looked over at Sage with a smile.  "Your usual, hun?"

"Yes, ma'am.  Though his sounds reall good."

Bonnie left and took our orders with her.  She brought coffee over and poured two black cups before she left.  My leg pressed against Sage's and it was difficult to move without elbowing him.  Sage had elbowed me three times in that short time.  "Maybe this isn't as easy as I'd like it to be," Sage said.

"I don't mind."  I leaned back and put my arm around Sage on the top of the booth's bench.  "Is this how you sit when you are on dates?"

Sage nodded.  "I like to touch my partner.  Playing footsie and holding hands is nice and all, but I'd rather be able to do this."  He leaned over and kissed me hard on the mouth.  My body reacted and I brought my other hand up around his neck holding him close and deepening the kiss.  His tongue darted into my mouth and I let out a small moan.  

By the time Sage pulled away my knees felt weak, and I had to catch my breath.  Sage's lips were swollen from kissing me and I bit my bottom lip at the look on his face.  God, I wanted him.  I grinned at him.  "I didn't expect that."

Sage grinned.  "It's your birthday."

"I could think of something else you could do for my birthday."  I said with a wink.

Sage leaned in and whispered in my ear, "Nope.  Not yet."

I laughed.  "I didn't think so."  I took a sip of my coffee and smiled at Sage.  "I am good with that."

Bonnie brought our breakfast and sat it down in front of each of us with a tall chocolate shake with two straws.  

I looked up at her and rolled my eyes.  She interrupted before I could say anything at all.  "It's your birthday.  Indulge me."

"Yes, ma'am."  I picked up the shake and took a sip of it, then smiled at Bonnie.

Sage took it from my hand and handed it to Bonnie.  "Bring it back later please.  It'll ruin our breakfast."

I looked at Sage with a grin, "That's kinda why she brought it out now.  I don't indulge on such things but when I do it's before."

Sage smiled brightly at Bonnie, "Please?"

"You don't have to bring it back at all, Bonnie."  I said.  I didn't need ice-cream.

Sage looked at me with a wide grin, "Of course she does.  Just not for breakfast."

I nodded to Bonnie, "You heard the man."

She raised an eyebrow behind Sage's back questioning the situation I only smiled back.  Sage turned to his own plate and pressed his leg against mine and picked up his fork with his left hand and his right fell to my knee and he squeezed, "Eat."

I winked at Bonnie and did as he asked.  I grinned at Sage, "It's better that we sat on this side, anyway."  If we'd sat on the other side, we'd be bumping elbows as we ate.  Now we could hold hands while we ate, and that's what we did as I slide my hand between his hand and my leg and curled my long fingers around his.  

Sage grinned down and looked at the color on my nails. "You always match them?"

I shook my head.  "No, I'm still sporting the usual club look.  Nails change as they chip."

Sage set his fork down and pointed to a chipped spot on my index finger, "Like that one?"

I nodded, "Yeah.  Now it's going to drive me crazy.  Thanks."  I stuck my tongue out at him.

"Don't do that."  Sage warned with a smile.

"Why not?"  I asked playfully.

"You might not get it back."  He teased as he popped a forkful of scrambled eggs and bacon into his mouth.

I grinned at Sage.  "That might not be so bad."

It stabbed the steak I had already cut on my plate and pulled my attention back to my food.  "Eat."

"All right, all right."  

We ate in relative silence, holding hands and our legs pressed against each other in the booth.  Several people had come and gone in the time we ate our meal.  

When Bonnie placed the check and another chocolate milk shake on the table I reached for the check and Sage moved faster than I had expected and was pulling it from underneath my hand and handing Bonnie cash.  "I got it.  I asked you here remember.  No macho games.  Whoever asks pays."

"What if we don't ask, like it's a agreed upon stop because we were hungry?"  I asked playfully as I pulled my hand back.

Sage laughed.  "Always plan everything?"

I shrugged. "Not everything.  I'm not good with surprises honestly."

"I could tell you I would rather always pay.  Would that bother you?"  Sage asked with a smile.  I wasn't sure if he was being serious or if this was some test.

"No.  It wouldn't bother me.  But it makes me wonder how much more you'd want to control."  Was Sage one of those men who had to be in control? Did he need someone who would obey everything?  

The look on Sage's face was a little worrisome.  His eyes were warring with something inside.  I put my hand on his knee and smiled.  "I can give you control when we are together.  I don't need to be alpha male."

Sage smiled back, but it didn't reach his eyes.  "You are already an alpha."  He stood up and offered his hand.  "I want you to meet someone."

I took his hand, and we walked out of the diner with a wave to Bonnie.  It was a short walk to the train station and we went two stops down before switching trains and heading into another part of town.  

Everyone knew the City was broken up into territories.  What the humans didn't know is that it had even more lines they didn't know about.  The Venatori controlled most of both the Upper East and West sides and all of Midtown. Vampires controlled all of Harlem, Manhattan Valley and Carnegie Hill. And theÂ wolves controlled Hell's Kitchen and Turtle Bay, and everything south of Midtown.

Sage got off the train in the heart of Hell's Kitchen.  We were in wolf territory.  I pulled the hood of my sweat shirt up as I followed Sage.  He held my handÂ like it was no big deal.  He thought nothing was wrong, I hoped that the wolves didn't think I was here out of context.  It had been many years since I'd come into Hell's Kitchen on anything but Venatori business.  

The buildings looked familiar.  Sage started into one of the four story apartment buildings I knew were wolf territory and I pulled my hand from Sage's grasp.  "Why are we going in there?"

Sage looked at me with pleading eyes.  "Please.  No one will hurt you.  I promise."

I took a deep breath and took Sage's hand he had continued to hold outÂ "Sage, what are you getting me into?"

"Nothing.  I promise.  It's not going to start a war."

"So you know where I am?"  I was confused even more now.

"Yes.  Please.  Nox, come with me."  I sighed and resigned myself to follow Sage.  I pulled my hoodie around me tighter like I felt cold, but I wasn't cold from the air.  It was old memories.  I could feel the wolf energy prickling my skin.  It wasn't safe for me here.

Sage knocked on a door and pulled me against him and took my hood down.  "It's okay.  I promise."

I heard rustling on the other side of the door and then the door unlatched and a woman answered.  She was wearing a small apron and covered in flour.  "Sage.  Darling, what a surprise."

"Mama Rose, this is my friend Nox."

I nodded to her and bowed my head.  I could feel the power of the pack behind her.  She spoke, "Come on in boys."

She moved into the house and towards the kitchen and I followed Sage through the apartment after closing the door behind us.  I saw pictures of the family on the hallway wall as we passed them.  I stopped when I saw a familiar face andÂ swallowed hard. Â Sage was looking at me when I turned.  "You okay?"

I nodded.  "Yeah.  Things make sense now.  Or are starting to."

Sage smiled and headed into the living room.  The TV was on and a man was sitting on the couch.  I stopped in the doorway and stared at the large Hispanic man watching television.  "Adrian."  I whispered.

I looked at Sage, "Why have you brought me to your alpha?  He is your alpha right?"

Sage nodded.  "I'm not a werewolf if that's what you are afraid of."

I frowned.  "I knew that from the get-go.  But I didn't know you were the foster son of Danny Morgan.  When did they bring you in?"

Sage sat down on the floor facing Adrian.  "When I was adopted by the Morgan's."

"You knew who I was the first time we met?"  I asked.  "When I was with your friend, Alice?"

Sage nodded.  "I knew of you, yes.  You are kinda a legend here.  Danny works with you.  Our alpha helped you, I know that much."

"I paid Adrian to help me."  I qualified.  "It wasn't because he was a wolf."

"I know.  You've been sharing all these big things with me.  This is all I have left.  And your questions made me think you needed to know."  Sage frowned.

"You are omega?"  I asked.

But Sage didn't have time to answer, Adrian interrupted him. "No.  He's not.  He's under pack protection until he turns, or taken as someone's mate."

"He can't turn. Adrian, he's a path."

Adrian smiled.  "I know.  He doesn't. We'd have already turned him, he's well past the age."

There was one nagging question in my mind and I had to ask it, "Did you?  with him?"  Adrian was a psychologist by professional standards, but he was more of a sex therapist than any traditional one.  I had paid him to teach me not to be a victim.  It wasn't about the sex, but it was still the same typeÂ training he did with some of his clients.  It was how he met his wife.  They ran the business together and shared in the kinkier side of it.  Adrian was a dominant male, and he'd been my top for many years.  Until I grew too powerful he said.

Adrian was smiling while he waited for my brain to refocus on him.  He was used to my thought process even after the years of absence.  He shook his head.  "No."

"Then why does he speak to me the way he does?"  I asked. 

Adrian's grin grew wider.  "I advised him how to catch you."

"Catch me?"  I sounded as confused as I was.

"He came to me a few weeks after you first met him in Aspect.  When you went off with the girl.  He said he'd met you in person.  I saw how he spoke about you.  I gave him a few pointers on how to act around you and treat you if he truly wanted to capture your attention."

I knelt down in front of Sage who had been picking at the carpet he sat on.  "So you don't really want the control you were asking for? You were playing me?"

Sage looked up and I could see the tears in his eyes and I wanted to dry them.  I didn't want to see him sad.  I had to look down at the floor.  He put two fingers under my chin and made me look at him.  "I liked how you reacted to me, how you'd smile and go with what I said.  When I gave you the card and took ..."  Sage blushed but I wouldn't make him say it here, if we'd been alone I might have.  "I didn't think you'd call me because I'd been so forward.  Then I got the text you didn't send me.  But you called me afterwards.  I like the power.  But you are an alpha, I feel it.  I couldn't take control that was yours to have.  The pack would kill me for overstepping."

I smiled at Sage.  "They will have to go through me to do that."  I turned around and sat down next to Sage and put my hand on his leg and looked up at Adrian who was smiling.  

He chuckled and called out, "Rosella, you have raised the pup well.  But I think he out grows us."

Rosella came out with a plate of freshly baked cookies and placed them on the coffee table in front of Adrian.  "He will always be my pup and always welcome here."  She gave Adrian a hard stare.

"He will always be welcome in the pack.  But I think his standing will change."

Sage got up on his knees and crawled to Adrian, "I can't get any lower."

Adrian put his hand on Sage's head, "Not lower, little one."

Sage looked up at Adrian, "What do you mean?"

Adrian just smiled.  "I'm sure we will all see."

Adrian grabbed a cookie and stood up.  "Nox.  It's been a pleasure.  Take care of my pup.  Or should he be the one taking care of you?"

I stood up and offered my hand to Adrian.  "I think we need to take care of each other, Adrian."

He took a bite of the cookie with a smile.  When he finished, he yelled, "Excellent cookies, Rosella."  He turned back to me, "And excellent answer."

Adrian left the room and the house with little more than a fond farewell to Sage's foster mother.  Sage still sat on the floor on his hands and knees looking at the floor.  I sat down on the couch and looked down at his bowed head, "You don't have to stay that way, he's gone."

"He wasn't the only alpha in the room."

I laughed.  "I'm not going to order you around. I am not pack.  You do not need to heed in any terms."

Sage looked up and shook his head. "You are pack.  I feel it."  Sage sat back on his heels and put his hand against his heart, "I feel it where I feel the rest of the pack.  Adrian considers you pack.  You are pack."

I sighed.  "Fine.  We'll do this proper then.  I yield my power to you and only you Sage Morgan. I am yours to command."

There was a gasp from the kitchen from Mrs. Morgan as she eavesdropped on our conversation.  But it was Sage who was looking at me with wide sapphire blue eyes, "Do you know what you did?"

I nodded. "Yes.  I'm not pack so I didn't feel whatever power shift you did, but I feel it's different in the room now."

Sage shook his head, "You are lower than me now?  Why did you do that?"

"I am lower than you, but I didn't sink to the bottom.  I raised you above me.  You command my power in the pack.  Whatever that means since I'm not pack.  I did it because you liked the way it felt to take charge of me.  No one can confront you now about being controlling with me because I gave you my power to control."  

I took a breath and continued, "You could make a move with that power.  If you do and we end this, you would be in a terrible situation.  Unless you kept the power, and I then had no choice but to do as you asked with in pack laws.  But I'm Venatori.  My rules out weight your rules by the Clandestine Providence.  I can't do my job if you had complete control of my abilities."

"Why though?  We aren't even dating." Sage asked.

I smiled, and I leaned my forehead against his and whispered, "I like when you tell me what to do. I need you to."

Sage grinned at me, "So even if I hadn't brought you here you would have given the power to me?"

I sighed, "NotÂ all of it.  Even Adrian will tell you, I am not a perfect submissive.  But I like when decisions are taken from me.  So not having to worry about who is paying is a relief.  My schedule is part of my coping mechanism to get through the anxiety of my nightmares and the daily changes of adult life.  The less I worry about the better I feel, and the more time I can feel safe."

Sage asked, "You have you all figured out don't you?"

I shook my head.  "No, Sage I don't.  I learn things everyday."

He grinned.  "What did you learn today?"

"So far," I smiled, "I've learned I need to trust you."  

Sage looked confused, "You don't trust me?"

I shook my head.  "I trust you.  I don't want to trust you.  I need to trust you.  Like I need to breathe."  I emphasized want and need to make my point.

Sage smiled and took my hand, "Let me show my childhood bedroom."  We stood, and I followed Sage deeper into the apartment he grew up in.  This was not what I expected on my birthday.



# A Big Mess

Sage's bedroom tour lasted all of five minutes.  It was unchanged from his youth.  An archaic computer was sitting on the desk.  There were pictures of his friends pinned to the corkboard above his desk.  I recognized them from the club though I couldn't tell you their names.  But I remembered the girl with the purple hair though in the picture she wasn't coloring her blond locks.  

There was a poster of David Bowie hanging on the wall above his bed which made me smile.  We'd have to talk music one day.  There were pictures of Steve Jobs and other computer geeks from what I could tell.  Sitting on top of the dresser was a small toy collection arranged in a row, like they had been there their whole lives.  R2-D2, Lego men, a few matchbox cars, but what caught my attention was the little red dragon sitting next to R2-D2.  It was the only thing in the room that had captured my attention other than Bowie.  I picked up the little red dragon and smiled.

Sage's watched me but he never said anything.  I put Mushu down and turned to him, he was smiling at me, "That meant something?"

I smiled at him.  "Mushu was my only friend once upon a time.  Sadly, he perished in a fire I started."

I walked out of Sage's room and he followed me to the kitchen.  "Mrs. Morgan.  It was a pleasure to meet you.  I need to get going." Â I offered her my hand and she dusted off her hands before taking it.

Sage frowned, "I though you were mine the rest of the day."

I held up my phone that had been vibrating nonstop for the entirty of our time in Sage's bedroom.  There were ten messages from Dae'lin on it. 

All of them were identical to the last one.

> Little Miss Boss  
> 664-555-4189  
> Sun, 06/24/2015  
> ****  
> Call me  
> 11:32 AM  

I held up the phone to Sage, and he took it and scrolled through all the messages.  "I guess you should call her then," he grinned. "So much for tradition."

"Would it be too much to ask that you walk me home?"  I asked.

Sage grinned.  "I'd love to."  He turned to his foster mother in the kitchen and leaned inside to speak to her. "Mama Rose, I'll be back for dinner.  Since my plans have changed."

We left his childhood home and headed for the subway station that would take me home.  I asked, "You live in Hell's Kitchen?"

Sage nodded, "Not far from Danny and Rosella."

When the train came, it was full, and we stood holding on to a strap facing each other.  The stop and go of the car pushed and pulled us apart, but we said nothing until we were heading up to the street on foot.  Sage had broken the playful silence.  "Are you sure you want to give me that kinda power?"

I smiled at him.  "It'll keep you safer. You weren't going to stop doing what Adrian suggested were you?"

Sage frowned and shook his head.  There was a small blush creeping up his neck, and I wanted to kiss it away.  "No.  I liked it.  I liked how you reacted."

"Good.  It will keep the pack off your back.  I won't have to protect you and start a war."  I breathed. "And when I'm with you, I can relax a little.  I trust you."

"You barely know me."  Sage grinned.

"That is true.  But it is still true.  I'm not looking for someone to boss me around. Not a submissive pet.  I don't like surprises or change.  Change terrifies me but it's inevitable and I cope and adapt to it.  My life is ordered.  I'm trusting you to help me add order not make it more chaos."  I smiled.  "No pressure, right?  ButÂ keep doing what you are doing and we can work on everything else.  I talk a lot if you hadn't noticed.  Years of therapy - talking is coping."

Sage laughed.  "It's a good thing I like listening to you then."

"Let me call Dae'lin.  Maybe I don't have to come in."  I doubted it but it was at least worth a shot.

The phone rang and Dae'lin picked up.  "I'm sorry Nox.  I know it's your birthday, the one day you have off.  But she will only talk to you."

"Really?  I have to come in.  It can't wait until tomorrow?"  I asked.

She sighed. "Gary is furious with you.  It was an easy job.  Walker was with you, she should be dead by all accounts.  They want this over with."

I sighed.  "Fine I'll be there soon."

"Thanks."  Dae'lin hung up the phone, and I frowned at Sage.  

"I'm sorry."  

He smiled.  "It's okay.  We all got jobs."

"Mine is at all hours, every day.  I live where I work."  I looked up at the towering Apex Unlimited building and it's out of place curves in the New York Skyline but it was home it had always been home.  "Thank you for breakfast.  And everything else too."

Sage grinned.  "It's not a problem.  Call me when you can.  Even if it's at 3 am."

I nodded.  Sage ran his fingers through my hair, it had become a mop over the course of the day with no styling product in it.  He grinned at me, "And you don't have to hide the tattoo."  He traced the lines of the crossed swords at my temple.  "I like it."

"I wasn't hiding it.  But at first, I didn't think you could see it. You really don't know what you are, do you?"

Sage shook his head, "You called me a path?"

"You pull the magnetic patterns of the electric wires to you.  We call that a technopath.  You probably use it without even realizing it."

Sage frowned.  "So, I'm some technopath raised by wolves.  Yeah, that doesn't sound freakish."

I laughed.  "I'll tell you about my birth and we'll compare freak shows okay?  But Dae'lin will be angry if I don't show up soon."

Sage nodded. "All right.  Call me."  He leaned in and kissed my cheek.  

I pouted.  I was disappointed, but it was mostly for show.  It earned me a quick peck on the lips before he turned and waved at me, "Later, Nox."

"Bye, Sage."

I watched him walk back towards the train station.  He turned around twice before he turned the corner.  I waved at him each time and when he disappeared around the corner. Once inside, I headed up the stairs, taking them two at a time.

My breathing was elevated, but it was nothing I wasn't used to already when I reached the right floor.   Dae'lin was waiting for me outside the conference room.   We didn't have an interrogation room because we don't normally interrogate our marks.  I was the only one who brought them in.  Even then we didn't interrogate them.  This was different. 

The female dragon was sitting in the glass enclosed room looking rather broken until she saw me standing outside then she perked up.  I could see the pattern's Dae'lin was using to hold her bonds.  

"Can I go in?"  I asked Dae'lin.

"That's why you are here," she smiled at me though it didn't reach her dark eyes.  

I walked into the room and her eyes went wide as I sat down and the bonds around her released.  I waved at Dae'lin.  "You will stay put or I'll have to put them back on."  I wrapped her up in a weave of air in that moment.  When she froze I let her go.

"Got it?" I asked.

She nodded.

"My name is Nox.  You are?"

"Naomi."  she said.

I nodded.  "What's your son's name?"

She smiled.  "Drake."

I laughed.  "Ironic?"

"I suppose.  Gordon liked it."

"The man with you?"  I asked.

She nodded. 

"He's going down for your robberies you know that,Â right?"

She frowned.  

"Your son?  Tell me why you freaked out when I said to let the dragons come get him."

"He's half human.  You know, damn well, they'll kill him.  It's the law."

I grinned.  "And yet you are robbing banks and breaking human law.  See we have a problem.  If I can promise you protection for you son, will you tell me about what The Dragon wants."

Naomi nodded.

I waved my hand and Dorian came in.  "Dorian, can I  protect the half dragon boy?"

"Only way you can keep him from the dragons is to put him under Venatori protection.  No one here will put him under their protection."

"Can I put him under my protection?"

Dorian smiled.  "You are of legal consenting age, so yes."

"How do I protect him?"  I asked.  I knew the answer, but I wanted Naomi to understand.

"You could adopt him.  It would be easiest." Dorian put papers on the table.  "I had the papers drawn up.  The Dragon Council will not take him from you, he'd become one of us like a human would."

"And all I have to do is sign the paperwork?"  

"And the parents of the boy if they both survive."  Dorian pushed the papers to Naomi.

She looked at me.  "You will personally protect my son?"

"That's what I'm proposing if you tell them about The Dragon."  I stood up and smiled.  Dorian handed her a pen.

Naomi signed the paper and set the pen down.  I signed the paper after her.  "Dae'lin, she's all yours.  If she doesn't tell you everything.  Tear up the paperwork."  Naomi gasped as I walked out the door.  Dorian had followed me.

I turned to look at my friend and mentor with a smile, "How did you know?"

He grinned at me, "I have known you since you were five, Nox.  You don't think I learned anything at all about you?"

"That's not it.  I get that you know me, how did you know that would satisfy her?  You knew I'd sign the paper, but you knew nothing more than that she wanted to keep her son safe.  That paperwork had my name as guardian printed on it.  Meaning you knew what I'd do."

Dorian smiled.  "I knew you would protect that child with everything you had.  And I knew without a shadow of a doubt you would not let that child grow up like you did - alone and parent-less.  And I knew you were ready to be a father.  What I hadn't gathered was that you were ready to be an adult."

"What's that supposed to mean?"  I asked.  We headed towards the stairs, Dorian was one of the few people who always took the stairs with me.  He disliked the fear in my eyes, even though I rode the glass elevator.

Dorian chuckled at me as we started up the stairs.  "That you actually wanted to settle down.  I figured I'd be doing a lot of babysitting while you went out at night to find a new coping mechanism to satisfy your desire for human companionship."

"You've been talking too much to Margo, Dorian."  

Dorian laughed.  It echoed in the stair well as we walked up the few flights of stairs to the Academy.  Dorian never asked me where I was going, I think he knew already.

"Will you tell Margo of your blue-eyed boy tomorrow?"  Dorian asked.

"Of course.  There is a lot to tell. And not just about him."

Dorian touched my arm, and we stopped in the middle of the stairs.  "I'm proud of you.  Not only do you stand up for what you believe in, you carry it through.  You..."

I smiled at Dorian.  "I got it, you don't have to say it and make it all mushy and uncomfortable."

"Your father is proud of you, too."  Dorian said with a smile as we continued back up to the Academy.  I wished to ask the little dragon if he wanted to stay with me.  He had to wait until he was under my care, but I didn't want him to freak out either.  But the subject of my father made me frown.

"He has a funny way of showing it."  I laughed.

Dorian nodded.  "He never showed home much he cared as aÂ father.  I do not regret keeping the secret, Nox.  You needed a father, but Kai wasn't going to be the father you needed."

"And you were?"  I asked.

Dorian shook his head.  "No.  I never wanted to be a father to you.  You were my charge.  I cared for you in only that manner at first.  It's why I missed Garrett.  You were the first child I'd had custody of in the legal sense.  I was not the parent you needed anymore than Kai was."

I smiled. "But you and Margo were the guardians I got.  I'm the man I am because of your direction.  I like who I am.  So don't be so hard on yourself.  I'm not a complete screw up."

Dorian laughed.  "Some would beg to differ."

"Some always will."  I stopped and hugged Dorian.  He had frozen when I wrapped my arms around his shoulders but he relaxed and let me, he even wrapped his arms around me.  I felt the complete urge to pull away, but I didn't.  I was learning to let people in.

Dorian was chuckling when he let me go.  "Sage, has known you what? Three days, and already the scared little boy is retreating into the man he became."

I grinned.  "I'm learning.  I'm trying."

Dorian nodded.  "Don't fall too far down the rabbit hole too fast.  Climbing out will not be as easy as falling."

I laughed.  "I know, but I think I already fell all the way down and I have to learn to climb back out."  I added as we climbed the stairs.  "I've told him things, shown him things only you and Margo know. Â He knows aboutÂ my nightmares.  He's seen the damage.  And the funny thing is, his life is as messed up as mine.  His parents died. Â Sage was separted from his brother. He bounced around foster homes because he was a terror, which was likely his untrained technopathy.  He got caught by Â a good FBI agent who took him in and became a loving father.  But that man is also a wolf."

Dorian's eyes went wide with the knowledge, "Dominic Olmos' group?"  I shook my head and Dorian relaxed.  "Hell's Kitchen at least is friendly to you.  Sheridan is a good man."

Dorian knew what Adrian had done for me as a kid.  Dorian hadn't liked it but when Margo had agreed with him Dorian's opinion didn't matter.  "So Sage?..."

"Did you know I was part of the pack?"  I asked Dorian.

"Adrian has always considered you family.  I assumed he brought you in for your protection.  You didn't know?"

I shook my head.  "I was thirteen when Adrian first found me. I didn't understand a lot then."

"You don't feel the pack then?  Humans always do.  Or those whom we've spoken to in the past."

"Sage does." I answered.  "But I don't.  I feel their energy when I'm close but like now I don't feel connected to them." I blurted, "I gave Sage my power."

"Why?"  Dorian asked in shocked wonder.

"Because I needed him to have it.  He needs the power to protect himself if word ever got out that he's dominant over me.  They'll have to go through me to get at him now."

"You always surprise me, Nox.  Always.  I'm surprised you gave up control so easily."

I laughed.  "Dorian, I don't want to be in control.  I control it so I don't freak the fuck out.  If someone else wants the control, they can have it."

"He's willing to control everything, Nox?"

I shook my head.  "He doesn't control everything.." 

"You can't be passive in your relationship, Nox."  Dorian warned.

"I know.  I have a lot to work on in a relationship.  Worry about whether Sage likes Mexican shouldn't be one of them.  And you know I'll freak out making the plans - the change alone is gonna kill me, the planning?"  I sighed. Â "Besides, he likes telling me what to do.  He spoke with Adrian after I'd been with his friend."

Dorian shook his head and opened the door to the landing of the Academy where Drake was being held.  The school was just as I remembered it.  The halls, the smell - especially the smells.  So much of my anxiety was linked up in smells I could feel the stress just filling my bones.  I took a deep breath and focused on what I should be doing - meeting my potential new roommate.  

He was more than that, but right now we didn't know each other.  One step at a time.

Dorian lead me down the hall to the toddler enclosures.  They were rooms with half walls where the kids played with toys while their teachers were teaching other classes.  It was more daycare than actual teaching at this age.  And nearly every child of Venatori between the ages of 8 weeks and 4 years old was in these walls at the same time.  

If you wanted to wipe the future of the Venatori off the planet, you only had to blow up one building.  This one.  There were strict measure in place to prevent a near extinction level event like that.  Short of planes flying into the building we we're good.  Though New York City's record for flying planes into building was pretty tarnished thanks to the events of 9/11.  That was one fucked up day!

I was 9 the day the Twin Towers fell.  It had happened across town, but I remember the world collapsing around us.  The shake of the ground as they fell.  The panic of the City, and the brotherhood it had inspired afterwards.  All of it etched into my small mind.  That event helped fuel my discomfort in flying.  I've flown once after that and it was pure terror.  I felt like I was five years old again.  When I came back to New York City to work, I drove back.  I've not driven a car since then either - but that's not out of fear - that's out of why the fuck would I want to when I can walk anywhere I need to or hop a bus or train and get there without having to deal with traffic myself.  No stress is my way of life.

Dorian tapped my shoulder, and I turned into the room he'd indicated.  My mentor knew me too well.  I smiled at him and he led me through the hall to where Drake was partioned off from the rest of the classes.  The half door was painted orange, and I frowned.  I looked at Dorian and he only nodded.  

The orange door meant these kids were potential fire-starters, or they were.  Inside five kids played.  Drake looked no different from any other toddler until he looked up at me and sniffed the air.  Dorian chuckled.  "He reminds me of you."

"What do you mean?" I asked.

"You use to do the same thing every time I walked in the room.  You don't remember?"  He was watching me watch Drake.

I shook my head.  "But, I guess, I did it.  I know I always, even now, smell you before I see you."  I grinned at Dorian, "And I mean that in the best possible way."

"I know.  Cinnamon and vanilla - I smell like cookies to you."  He chuckled.

"That's not how I thought of it - the best part of apple pie."

"You hate apple pie."  Dorian said as he frowned at me.

"I hate eating it, the smells however are very hard to make me see the evil that is apple pie."  I was frowning now - the bad memories overriding the good ones always happened when apple pie came up.

A little girl who couldn't be over six looked up at me.  "Why don't you like apple pie?"

The answer was simple, but how do you tell a child you hate apple pie because your mother made it and it was the only good memory you had of a bad mother.  So I told a half truth.  "It brings up bad memories."

Dorian added in my mother's defense, "And a singular good one.  Tell them."

I sighed.  "When I was younger than you, my mother made apple pies all the time.  I remember the smell of the crust baking in the oven before she would do anything else.  The clean crisp scent of the apples cooking down in the vanilla and cinnamon."

Another little boy looked up at me and waved his hands at me urgently.  The same girl grinned and said, "Joey says that sounds like a good memory."

I nodded.  "It is.  But all the bad things my mother did afterwards kinda ruined the whole thing."

Another boy asked, "What she do that was so bad?"

I looked to Dorian, and he nodded.  He leaned over and whispered, "They all have troubles too.  Tell them."

I sighed.  "My mother had been out.  She'd been hunting, and I was excited to see my mother, and my Nanny was sick so I made myself cereal.  I made a mess.  My mother came in and she was angry.  She shook me and I was afraid.  I was five when my ability first came in that moment.  I watched as the curtains caught fire out of my fear."

I looked past the children at the far wall and I could see the flames rising higher and higher in my minds-eye.  "My mother rushed for the fire extiquisher and put it out.  I was staring. Afraid of her and the fire and I didn't know what was going on.  My mother threw the red tube at me missing my head.  She yelled at me, spat at me, called me a monster and sent me to my room."

I remembered picking up the little red dragon that was my only true friend and holding him tigh.  "That evening my mother packed my bag.  And early the next morning she was dragging me on to a plane.  I was crying and dragging my feet and it only made my mother worse.  I freaked out on the plane so bad my mother had to give me medicine that knocked me out.  When I woke up I was waiting at the airport terminal.  That was when I met Mr. Dorian for the first time.  He smelled like cinnamon and vanilla.  He made me feel safe.  I needed that then."

Drake looked up at me and smiled.  "You smell safe."

I smiled.  "Do I?  What do I smell like?"

He frowned, "Like Mama."

"Why are you sad?"  I asked him.

"I miss Mama."

I nodded.  "I bet you do.  I missed mine too when she left me with Dorian."

"Did she come back?"  Drake asked.

I sighed and shook my head.  "No, Drake, my mother didn't love me like your mama loves you.  She asked me to take care of you for her while she's not with you. Will that be okay?"

Drake smiled. "Go now?"

I shook my head.  "After school.  You can come home with me, okay?"  I looked at Dorian and he nodded, "The paperwork was pushed through this morning without the signatures."

I grinned at him.  "You know me well."

Dorian smiled.  "I knew even if she doesn't tell us about The Dragon you'd take him in.  Without a shadow of a doubt."

I grinned down at Drake.  "I will come and get you when you get out.  If I'm busy, Mr. Dorian will pick you up and take you to his house and I will get you there, okay?"

He nodded.  "Play now."  I nodded in return and Drake went off to play with his friends.  I waved at the five little ones and Drake waved back.

"So which one was your son Dorian?"  I grinned at him as we walked away.

"How did you guess?"

"I know you you as well as you know me.  You were comfortable walking in to the kiddie rooms.  No one questioned you being there."

"The little red head.  His name is Aidan.  He wasn't planned."

I laughed.  "Obviously not.  You don't like women, Dorian, so how does one accidentally have a baby?  I'd sure as hell like to know how that worked out for you."

Dorian sighed.  "You remember those six months I was out of town?"

I nodded.  "Yeah,Â that was like five years ago.  They'd been hounding you."

"I left to decide if I could preform.  I hooked up, as you'd say, with a human girl.  Accidents happened, but she failed to inform me before I told her I was gay.  That any relationship would fail because I was incapable of making her happy.  After Aidan was born, her mother found my contact in her phone and sent me a nasty email.  I've been sending her money since. When Stella lost her job a few months back, I arranged for her to get a job here."

I frowned, but I understood.  "Taste like shit when it happens to you, huh?"

Dorian nodded.  "I know you forgive me for not telling you about your father, but yes it does.  Stella is having issues with the whole Venatori life style, but both you and I know Aidan needs to be here."

"So what's up with the rest of the kids then?"

"The twins - Joey is deaf so the whole care thing is difficult, but since his sister can speak with him she's here, though she's not in the 'troubled' child category.  Henry is shy and when he's not he's mean.  So he's a disciplinary problem. Aidan's still integrating and they keep him here until he and his mother do."  Dorian sighed.  

"Well good thing she survived, or you'd be beating yourself up more than you already are.  You'll be a great fad, too bad that don't count."  I grinned playfully at him.

"I know, right? Proof is in the pudding though, so now I have to.  Can't deny that it's not a biological impossibility.  Any tips?"

I laughed, "On having sex with a woman?  For you?  Doggie style works, don't let her get nekkid.  Wham bam, thank you ma'am." Â I smacked my hands together like I was dusting them off.

Dorian turned a dark shade of red and muttered, "Forget I asked."

I laughed.  "You knew what I would say."

"No, actually I didn't. You'd think I'd have at least known the gist of it though."  Dorian rolled his eyes.  "So, your blue-eyed boy?  How'd breakfast go?"

"Great.  He then took me home, and that happened and I saw his childhood bedroom.  And then Dae'lin called."  I smiled.  "I should go check on Naomi."

Dorian nodded.  "The boy's things will be delivered to your room for tonight.  He has nothing from home, maybe you can go get some since you know where they lived.  He might feel more comfortable."

I nodded.  "That sounds like an excellent thing."

Dorian laughed, "Maybe you can walk with your new boy toy."

I smiled.  "He is most definitely not my toy.  I might be his though."

Dorian blushed again.  "You'd think I'd learn.  Behave, Nox.  I'll see you later I'm sure."

We parted ways, and I went down to check on Naomi.

Naomi was sitting in the room alone.  I grabbed Walker by the arm and turned him towards me, "What's going on?  Why is no one talking to her?"

"She won't talk to anyone but you.  She keeps throwing fire at us.  Anytime anyone gets near the door."

"Why didn't anyone call me?" I asked.

Dae'lin smiled as she stopped in front of me, "I knew you'd be back.  The boy okay?"

"He's fine.  He's happy to come stay with me."  I sighed, "I was going toÂ stop by her place and get some of his things, maybe he'd feel more comfortable."

Dae'lin nodded, "There is still plenty of time for that.  Go in there and get the information you want so Gary can do the rest."

Walker added, "He agreed I can take her out.  It's a crap feeling.  I thought it'd be better."

I shrugged.  "You do what you gotta do."  

I walked over to the glass walled room and I stopped just outside the door.  Naomi looked at me with those strange blinking orange eyes.  There was no fear in her eyes.  There was only sadness.  She knew her fate.  The only thing she had left was her son and the knowledge she would protect him in her death.  I hated doing it, but I neededÂ to play like I wouldn't care for him.  It's a good thing I could play pretend real well.

I opened the door, and she watched me walk in and take the seat opposite her.  "You need to talk to them.  They won't believe me.  You talk or the papers go up in smoke."

"You'd let a boy die?"  There was fear in her eyes now.

I shrugged.  "He's not my kin."  I lied.  I wouldn't let any child die if I could prevent it. With a dry smirk on my face I covered my feelings.  

She frowned.  "You wouldn't. He's just a boy. You'd let me live and him die?"

I shrugged again.  "I do what I need to do to protect humanity.  You and your friends possess knowledge of this threat.  He's a casualty of your failure to comply.  I can't help your actions.  I can't keep a dragon from his people."

She snarled at me, "Yet you keep me from my people."

"You forfeited your right to the dragon name when you showed the humans what you were.  You broke the only rule the Venatori enforce over any race as you may over any Venatori.  You showed the world we exist."   I frowned, "You know the law as well as I do."

She sat back and sighed.  "You will protect my son if I speak to you of The Dragon's plans.  Even though I only know what he asked of me."

"I will personally protect your son from the Venatori and the Dragon Council if you speak to anyone about The Dragon."

"I will only speak to you.  The others will kill me for anything I speak."  She sat taller and prouder, she wouldn't let them kill her without a fight.

"Okay, then.  Tell me what you were doing for The Dragon."  I wished for Dorian's photographic memory. But there were cameras in the room recording everything.  Someone would catch what I missed.  This was not my job, but I'd do it none-the-less.

"I was robbing banks.  But not in the traditional sense.  Computer's these days are vulnerable.  We planted the virus in the front machines, took the cash in the drawer and then his hackers would do the rest.  Destabilization he said."

"And you don't know why he wants to destabilize the economy?"  I asked.  It was a big deal to the humans, and to anyone who lived in today's world.  Money was everything even in the supernatural world - you didn't barter with others like you anymore, you had to pay for it like everyone else.

But Naomi shrugged.  "He's always afraid of the human uprising against us.  All the knights in shining armor coming back to kill us and take our hoards."

I smirked at the concept.  "He thinks his slayers were human?"

Again she shrugged.  "The world is built upon money and power.  He doesn't want the humans to have it.  So he'll take it from everyone."

"Anything else?"  I asked.

"I know he was planning on doing bigger things.  But I wasn't privy to it."  

"Do you know where he is?  Or where his hideout is?"

"No.  We never met.  I got my assignment from a third party."

"Tell me who that third party is?" 

"I can't.  And I won't.  He's not broken the law."  She glared at me with defiance in her eyes.  I could see the fire behind them, waiting for me to deny her son's safety.

"Tell me.  I won't kill him."  I looked up at the cameras and I gave it a smile.  I wove a pattern around us.  The light returned what they expected to see, nothing in the room.  The dome of air kept in the sound of our voices. "I will be the only one to know his name."  My voice bounced off the walls of air and distorted as they reached my ears.  It was always fun watching people understand the trick for the first time.

She looked around the room and I knew she saw nothing different, but she knew something had changed.  I smiled.  "Tell me."

She shook her head.  I added. "I will not kill this person.  On the life of my future children, I will not kill them."

Naomi looked at me for several long minutes.  The only sound we could hear was that of our own breath and the beating of our hearts.  She nodded.  "Valentino RodrÃ­gez.  He's a big time..."

I interrupted.  "He's a small time thug in lower Manhattan who is a lap dog of Dominic Olmos.  He's the go between for the wolves.  Not a violent man, but he's always for hire.  Why's he going between Dominic and The Dragon?"  I smiled at her I didn't expect her to know the answer to the question.  The wolves didn't work outside the CCB.  The Creed of Celestial Beings was branching out it seemed.

"Thank you."  I said as I dropped the dome above us and sound returned to normal.  Gary and Walker were pounding on the door I'd barred with air when I first walked in the room.  Gary's face was purple with rage and Walker's pulse was throbbing in his neck.  

I opened the door, and I turned back to Naomi.  "Thank you.  I will protect your son no matter what happens from this moment forward.  Don't kill my people or things might be out of my control."

She nodded, and I started for the elevator down the hall.  "Where you going?"  Gary shouted after me.

"I have a small dragon to take care of.  She won't have anything more to say will be helpful."  I stopped and turned to Walker.  "I'll be back in a few hours and we'll go over our next move."

Gary frowned, "This isn't your case, Nox!"

I smiled at him.  "It is now.  Dae'lin made it my case when she brought me on.  He can't do this without me.  You'll start a fucking war.  You know damn well the dragons are walking on the toes of the vamps and the wolves - something's gonna break.  They might be all cozy up at V&M but that is only because Marshall's sister is Chevalier to Desmond.  The finances are stable because of Romeo and Juliet but the CCB won't play nice with The Dragon if he's taking down their way of life.  The Dragon's hooking into Dominic's crew, whether it's with his knowledge or not we'll find out.  But my gut says Dominic's not in the know."

Dae'lin's eyes went wide, "You can't walk into Dominic's territory on Venatori business."

I smiled.  "I know that.  Thankfully,Â our little dragon lives in Hell's Kitchen.  Where I can walk freely.  I'll send Dominic word I need to talk, I'll take Walker with me. Dominic is usually forth coming when I ask first."

"I'll be back."  I turned, and I walked back towards the elevator there were a few things I needed to take care of.



# Informant

As I took the elevator down I pulled out my phone and I called Sage.  I smiled when I heard him answer, "Hey."

I said, "Hey yourself."  I know people in the elevator were looking at me strange, but I didn't care.  "I am going to be in your neck of the woods and was wondering if you'd like to walk with me while I'm out there?"

Sage chuckled into the phone.  "Are you asking me out on yet another date?"

I smiled.  "It would seem so.  I don't know when I'll have time to see you, my case just got bigger and right now I've got a few hours to burn while things come together and I run this errand."

"Alright, where do you want to meet?"  Sage asked quickly. 

I gave him the subway station I'd get off at and we could walk to the dragon's apartment from there.  I could get off a few stops closer but then I'd not get to see him as long.  And I really wanted to see him again.

When we finished our conversation I called the Alpha of the Manhattan pack.  I didn't have a direct line exactly, but I had a line anyway.  

He answered on the first ring.  "Dude!  Why am I not surprised to hear from you?"

"Glad to hear my voice Liam?"   I laughed softly. 

"No.  Dom's on a uber rage."

"Why's that?"  

"Dragon's man.  They are fucking everywhere."  Liam whispered.

"That's kinda why I'm calling actually.  I got word that he might wanna know and he might be able to help me find what I'm looking for."

"Dude!  You can't come down here now."  Liam was being overly cautious, he never cared about my safety before.  For a lowlife scum bucket Liam was lower than that.  At least in terms of the hierarchy of the pack.  He was weak and a drug user which usually meant that he couldn't handle being a wolf, but Liam was a drug addict before he became a wolf.  Addictions don't die when you change.  Liam had to be locked up at nights.  I'd once been sent after him and when I took him to Dominic instead of the Venatori Liam had been grateful.  Drugged out of his head but the wolf remembered me.  He had no choice but to agree with his wolf that I was a friend.

"Liam, man I gotta talk to Dominic."  I said flattly. "War is gonna come and I don't want that.  If he doesn't let me come down and talk this out, they'll send in the guns and the magic and take you all out.  Bigger things than vamps and wolves and Venatori are at stake here. The Dragon has bigger plans than that."

"Alright.  But you are making me put my head on the chopping block for you.  I'll do it."

"Thanks Liam, and I'll protect you from Dominic.  He won't hurt you if he has to go through me."

"Dude!  No way he'll back down."

I smiled.  "Don't worry about it Liam.  I'll handle Dominic."

"Alright, alright.  I'll call you back with details."

By the time the conversation was over I was outside the building and heading for the train station.  I was happy but also a little nervous.  Why was I doing all this bizarre things just to see a guy?  Sage was cute.  Gorgeous.  But I wasn't doing this to get in his pants.  I could have already done that.

I could contemplate that later there were bigger problems to deal with and Sage was a good distraction from it.  I could hold off on analyzing my love life for a little while, but the fact that I even had a love life was new and a big step.  Margo was going to have a lot to listen to tomorrow morning.

I focused on work.  My blue-eyed mystery boy could wait till I was staring into those blue eyes.  Just the thought of them made me weak.  I was so fucked.

Dominic was on a rampage.  The Dragon was using Val to do his go betweens.  Dragons were stepping it up this was not good.


The intercom announced with much static my stop and I got off still no closer to an answer, but I was about to see my blue-eyed boy.  I wasn't sure why I kept calling him that, I knew his name, he wasn't a mystery anymore.  But I loved his eyes - that was probably the only reason I had.  I started for the stairs up and leaning against the railing tapping away at his phone was Sage.  He'd changed from earlier.  Instead of the blue jeans he'd had on, he was wearing a pair of brown khaki's and a white button down shirt - very professional looking for a Sunday afternoon.  I must have caught him at work.

"You look good."  I said to him with a big smile.  He looked better than good and I was sure he saw that in the way I looked at him.  

Sage smiled at me and held out his hand for me to take.  I slide my painted fingers into his hand and he entwined our fingers together.  "So where are we going?"

"Around."  I grinned.  "I've officially adopted a little dragon.  He lived around here.  His mother is going away for a long time, his dad will be going to jail in the human world.  He was good leverage to get what we needed from her."

"What did you need from her?"  Sage asked as we stepped out into the afternoon air.  It was getting too hot and I was still wearing my skeleton sweatshirt from earlier.  I did what I did best and I used my ability to create a shimmering pattern no one could see that would suck the heat away from us.  Sage looked at me as the air had cooled dramatically.

I smiled at him but said nothing about the temperature.  "Information.  I promised her son protection from the Dragons and the Venatori and she gave up her boss and his connections she could."

"Sounds like a  pretty eventful day."  Sage grinned.

"The best part of my day has been with you."  I laughed softly, "Cheesy as it sounds."

Sage squeezed my fingers in his hand.  "I'm glad to make your day."

We walked hand in hand.  "I hope you'll make many more of my days."

Sage laughed, "You are full of cheese today."

"Sorry."  I grinned at him.  He laughed and we walked the few blocks to the apartment the dragon's had been staying in.  

Sage grinned.  "This is a dump.  I could take you someplace nicer."

"Oh yeah?"  I returned the grin.  I caught the front door as someone exited.  It was better than having to pick the lock to get in.  

Sage nodded.  "I live around the corner."

I bit my bottom lip. "Really?"

We went up to the fourth floor.  I tried the door but we'd locked it behind us when we left.  I sighed.  "You might want to go wait down there.  If you don't want to be an accessory to a B&E."

Sage smiled.  "I'm alright.  You intend on getting caught?"

"No.  And I do have permission to be here just didn't get a key."  I wove a quick weave that unbolted the door from the other side.   I opened the door and we walked inside.  "I need to grab a few of the boy's things, and then I can hang for a little while.  I told them I needed a few hours.  Then I have to get back to work."  I headed into the back of the apartment trying to find the boys room, or at least something that belong to him.

It was a small apartment.  It smelled slightly of burnt eggs.  Sage followed me and I wanted nothing more than to hold his hand.  "Why am I drawn to you Sage?"

He laughed.  "You tell me."

"I wouldn't be asking if I knew."  I turned around and smiled at him.  "But I'm not complaining."  I pushed opened a door and found a small bed on the ground.  A small Snoopy dog was lying on the bed with a rumpled and torn blanket.  I smiled.  "Found what I was looking for."  I picked up a bag in the corner and found clothes and other things for the boy.  I tucked Snoopy and the blanket inside the bag and slung it over my shoulder.  "You want to grab a taco on the way back to the station?"

Sage grinned.  "There's this great taco truck not far from here."  

"Lead the way."  I grabbed Sage's hand and I squeezed.  I surprised myself, but it felt right and I liked being close to him.

We walked slow chatting about inconsequential things, but I mostly focused on the feel of his hand, the sound of his voice.  Things that would get me through to the next time I'd see him.  Not that I couldn't just call him up again and go for a walk.  I was amazed at how easily I wanted to do the mundane things with him.  

Sage laughed at my drifting in and out of his story.  "You zone out a lot."

"Get lost in my head.  I'm sorry, I'll do better."

Sage smiled, "No worries."

We picked up a taco each, Sage paid.  There was no awkward moments.  I'd asked, but he had pulled out his wallet and was handing the guy cash.  Sage smiled at me.  "So you are okay with that?"

"I will be.  It's strange not paying."

Sage laughed, "Well one of us has to give it up."

I nodded.  "I'm okay with this."

We walked and talked while we ate our tacos.  We headed for the train I needed to grab, but we walked slow.  I don't think Sage wanted to leave anymore than I did.  But I did have to get back to work.  "I'll call you later tonight." I said without feeling like I was lying.  I wanted to call him.

Sage grinned.  "Good.  Anytime.  I don't care if you wake me up.  I'll probably be working late anyway."

I kissed Sage on the cheek.  He laughed.  "I'm surprised you didn't try for more."

I grinned.  "I'm following your lead."

"I've already kissed you."  Sage laughed.

"That was more a demonstration of why you sat next to your dates than actually kissing me."  I joked.

"Did you not like it?"  Sage teased back.

I smiled at him with an evil grin.  "Maybe.  I don't exactly remember."

Sage pulled me closer and whispered softly, "Maybe I should remind you?"

"You could."  I chuckled.

Sage pulled away and smiled.  "I think I'll make you wait."  He kissed my cheek gently. "You better catch your train, or you'll be here all alone for ten minutes."

"See ya, Sage."  I squeezed his hand and I went out down to the train before I missed it.  I glanced back up at the top of the stairs where Sage waited and gave him a little wave before I went down.  I had to push the sweet smell of lavender and jasmine from my mind, I had to work now.  There was danger on the horizon and I needed to be ready for it.


The train ride was slow as my mind sorted through the reasons why Dominic would be freaking out.  The Dragon was using wolves to do the run around.  I was still waiting on Liam to call.

I got off the train and headed for the Apex Unlimited building.  It was still hot but I would be back inside the air conditioning soon.  And the stress and anxiety of the latest hunt.  As I walked into the building my phone rang.  "Liam, what you got for me?"  I asked.

"Liam's not here right now.  Meet me at the usual place in ten minutes."  The alpha quickly hung up so I didn't get a chance to tell him about Walker.  But that was just going to have to be a surprise.

I stood in the lobby just in front of the Atlas statue and I called Walker.  

He answered, "Nox?  Where you at?"

"I'm downstairs.  We got a meet and greet, let's go." 

"Wait, what?  Come up stairs we can make the plan."  Walker instructed.

"We have ten minutes to get where we are going or we lose our chance. Dominick won't wait long for us.  So if you are coming get down here.  I"m leaving in three.  I hung up the phone and headed for the food court and got coffee for the alpha.  It was always good to come bearing presents.  And I knew Dominick favored a half soy latte grande from Starbucks.  I grabbed a black coffee for Walker if he showed.

I didn't have to wait long for Walker to come down the elevator.  "Let's go."  I handed him the black coffee and started for the door.

"So were we going?"  Walker asked as he nodded his thanks and then took a sip.

"Not far."   We walked to an old apartment building and around into the alley behind it.  There was a door in the alley that I knocked on three times.  A rusted creeking slide opened and a pair of amber eyes stared back.  I smiled and held up the coffee.  "Delivery."

The man on the other side snorted and shut the rusted slide and the sound of latches on the other side being unlocked before the heavy door opened up.  "He's back this way."  I felt the hum of wolf energy all around me.  They knew I was armed.  They probably knew Walker was armed.  

Walker was looking around warily.  "They are all wolves."

I nodded.  "They are."

"Why didn't they search us?"  Walker asked.

"Fernando, why didn't you search us?"  I grinned at the wolf leading us to Dominick.

"What good does it do to disarm you when you will just throw a fireball or wrap us up in air at a thought."  He smiled.  "We won't attack you, you don't attack us, that's the rule.  This is neutral territory."

"How is it neutral?"  Walker asked.

"It's owned by vampires.  If we kill anyone here it's a declaration of war.  There are several meeting houses around city that do for these type negotiations.  The vampires and the wolves use the Apex Unlimited Starbuck's as a place to negotiate when they have a need."

"So if I kill a wolf the Venatori declare war on the wolves?"  Walker asked with a grin.

"No.  You declare war on the vampires.  You violated their treaty.  And they will send Il Cane after you."

"Il Cane is just a myth."  Walker declared.

Everyone within hearing distance laughed.  "I'm sure she'd love to prove it otherwise to you when she rips your heart out," Fernando said.

Fernando lead us into a small room with only a table and four chairs with a small lamp.  A large burly man with slicked back hair and a scar down the left side of his face sat facing us.  The smile reached his good eye, the other was cast over with a light blue shading of blindness.  The wolf who had attacked Dominic had also taken an eye from him.  But the deficiency hadn't slowed down the one time gang banger from taking over the pack when he was just 23.  

I smiled and took a sip of the coffee before sliding it across the table to Dominick.  "I know you like a half soy latte."

"You are always so thoughtful when you come to visit."  He smiled.  "Who's the new boy toy?"

"Walker Moore.  Walker this is Dominick Olmos, Pack leader of the Manhattan Werewolf Pack."    Walker sat down.  I frowned.  

"He's presumptuous Venatori."  Dominick said.

"He's new.  He doesn't know how things work when we actually don't try to kill each other." 

"You might as well sit down too Nox.  I will let it go for now."  Dominick said as he offered me to sit.

I nodded and sat down.  "Thank you, Dominick.  I was assigned to help Walker with a dragon hunt.  We tracked the dragon down and she claimed The Dragon is going after some pretty big things against the humans.  I got a name from her that was her contact.  A name you might find familiar."

Walker started to say something and I put my hand on his arm.  "You can yell at me later."

Dominick nodded.  "What name?"

"Valentino RodrÃ­gez."  I smirked.  "She said The Dragon gave her the information through Val.  He's always been a problem child.  Did you know he was working with the Dragon?"

Dominick frowned.  "No.  He won't come when I summon him."

I laughed.  "Then you didn't really try did you?"

"I hate that you know so much about pack politics."  Dominick smiled.

"I had good teachers, what can I say."

"You had the same teachers as I do and I don't know what the hell you are talking about."  Walker interrupted.

"I wasn't talking about Venatori teachers, Walker.  I've been out here doing this for five years, I've had many teachers."  I smiled at Dominick.  "Try again for real.  If he doesn't come for you I will find him, and my friend won't be so nice."

"You know what you are asking me to do?"

I nodded.  "Yeah I do.  I'm sorry.  But you said it yourself he's not coming of his own free will.  He made his choice.  If it makes you feel better, call him now.  Ask again.  Tell him I'll come for him.  Better yet, I'll tell the vampires that he killed one of your men here and I'll let Il Cane come for him."  I smiled.  "I could by pass it all and just ask a favor of Ant."

"Jesus, Nox, you don't need to get the vampires involved.  I'll bring him here."  Dominick pulled out his phone and dialed a number without speed dial.  

"Valentino.  You need to come to me now.  The Venatori are here.  They have questions and I really don't want to send this one after you."

Dominick listened and then he laughed.  "You can only wish that I only sent the boy after you.  He's not alone.  You can pray he magics you away from the trigger happy pup he has with him."

I could listen in if I really wanted to but there was no need.  Val either came or he didn't.  Dominick frowned.  "Val, don't make me do this."

There was a pause again.  And then Dominick closed his eyes and I could feel the power move through him and the rest of the pack.  A few bowed their backs, other's fell to their knees.  He recited in a quiet voice, "Valentino, come to me."  The power pulsed and made it hard to breathe.  Dominick sipped at his coffee.  "You always bring the best gifts Nox.  The boys could learn a thing from you."

I grinned.  I looked over at Walker who was drowning in the power.  "You okay, Walker?"

"It's hard to breathe."  He eeked out.

I nodded.  I put my hand on his shoulder and fed him a little of my power.  "This helps."  He stared at me.

"It doesn't affect you?"

I shrugged.  "Wolf powers don't affect me.  Too human I guess."  Which wasn't a lie, but it wasn't the fact that I was half human that I was not affected by Dominick.

Dominick laughed.  "He's an alpha in his own right, kid.  Don't let him fool you.  He's pack just doesn't change.  He just gave you pack protection.  Not my pack."

"Who's pack then?"  Walker asked.

Dominick smiled, "His own.  Sheridan has essentially kicked him from the pack for being too powerful.  But since that would make him rogue, Sheridan extends his protection making him pack and confined to Hell's Kitchen."

"How is he a wolf, Venatori die from bites?"  Walker was as confused as I was at one point in my life. 

"I'm not a wolf.  I was taken in by Adrian when I was young.  I just grew more powerful as I got older.  I didn't do anything more than give your body the resistance to fight the power.  Which is Cesari not a wolf power."  I smiled as I heard the door open.  I stood up and turned around to see the weasel Valentino sulking through the doorway.  He was almost on all fours as he came in.  He stopped just short of my feet.  

"I come my Alpha."  Valentino whimpered.

"Sadly.  You didn't come the first twenty times I called.  Why shouldn't I just give you to the pup here?"  Dominick growled.

"I'm sorry.  My King.  I'll do better next time."  Valentino sounded even more pathetic than before.

I squatted down in front of the cowering man.  The power in the room had dropped significantly Dominick was focusing just on the wolf in front of us.  But he remained seated making Val stay low to the ground.

"Is it because you've been working with The Dragon, Val?"  I asked.

Val looked up with his dark black eyes that were starting to bleed amber from the power Dom was pulling through him.  There was fear in his eyes.  "He pays well.  I'm not switching sides.  I swear."

"Other than the female dragon, who else have you been taking messages back and forth to.  I need names, contacts and any information you've passed on verbally."

"He'll kill me."  Val cowered.

I looked back at walker. "You want to take that one?" I asked.

Walker pulled a gun and pointed it at Valentino's head.  "I'll kill you now.  I suspect Nox will protect you from this Dragon, as he does every other ally he seems to meet."

"You won't die here Val.  We won't start a war over you, but I'll let him kill you.  And your Alpha won't stop me.  You are implicated in a war on the humans.  You will talk and we will forget you aided The Dragon."  I sighed.  "I hate doing this Val.  But you give me no choice."

Walker took a step closer to enhance his position on the matter but he said nothing.  "I just talked to the three people here in the City.  They were his go to people they handled the rest.  I will give you the addresses where I met them."

"I want times and days you met them too."

Dominick smiled as he knelt down beside me.  "You are getting off easy, Valentino.  You will be paying for this for a while though.  You will not work against us again."

Valentino bowed his head.  I stood up and frowned, "Don't kill him, please."

Dominick stood up and puffed his chest out.  "Do you intend to interfere with pack business?"

"No, Dominick I don't.  I ask as a favor, punish him.  But please don't kill him.  I would owe you."

Dom's eyes grew wide and his teeth became a great smile.  "You would owe me?"

"Yes.  He may come in handy later.  I want him alive in case of that.  I will owe you a favor in return.  A deal you can't pass up."

"What's the condition, Nox?"  Dominick asked.  

"I won't participate in acts of war."  I said as I offered my hand.

Dominick nodded. "That's a fair trade."  Dominic patted the top of Valentino's head, "You have a guardian angel today.  Maybe he'll put you under his protection permanently if you play nice."  He grabbed him by the top of his hair and tossed him towards the table.  "Give him what he wants.  I need a smoke.  Nox?"

"I could use some fresh air."  Walker said as I nodded.  

Dominick nodded, "Fernando will bring out the information once it's been written down."

I nodded.  "Thank you, Dominick I greatly appreciate your help."


Outside the building Dominick leaned against the wall and pulled out a smoke and started puffing away at it.   We stood there for a while, while Walker walked to the end of the alley way and back.  Dominick spoke softly.  "Liam has already been paid for helping you."

"Why did you pay him for me?  I can manage."  I smiled.

"I paid him for me.  He won't remember that you didn't pay up.  I needed your help Venatori.  But I didn't want to call you.  I hate getting you involved, but I know you won't kill us, any of us without due cause."

"What's up Dominick?"  I ran my fingers through my hair.  Liam had said Dom was going off his rocker about the dragons.

"It's dragons.  You probably already got it under your plate, but they keep trying to overpower the wolves.  It's been slow.  The banks they are robbing, are in our territory, the vamps are getting antsy and think we need to stop it.  But they are having power outages and their human servants are having issues. The dragons are the culprits."

"You are saying that these things are isolated to your territories.  Not across the island completely?"  I asked.

"I don't know.  But that's what the vampires think too.  And we don't want to start a war.  Desmond and Marshall don't want to get you involved.  But we have to to prevent war.  They think you'll side with the Venatori, not the law."

I smiled, "You know better?"

"Marshall trusts you Nox.  I trust you.  Il Cane trusts you.  But the CCB they don't.  They don't know you like we do and Desmond and Marshall can't do much about it other than advise.  They are going to take matters into their own hands if the dragons aren't stopped."

I sighed.  "I'll do what I can.  Hopefully The Dragon is behind the dragon attacks you speak of.  He's trying to disrupt humanity for crimes they didn't commit."

Dominick laughed, "Who's crimes are they?"

"If I had to guess they are Venatori crimes.  Dragon slayers he believes were human.  We look human."

Walker joined us then, "You are human."

Dominick laughed.  "That's why we trust him over you.  He understands.  He'll clean up this mess without starting a war."

"You say I would start a war?"  Walker took a step closer I stepped between him.

"You don't know when to submit, and you don't know when to be a tough guy.  New York City isn't like other cities Walker.  We have less supernatural activity here because they work together.  Even the Venatori do."

Dominick sighed, "The Venatori don't keep the peace here, they are corrupted police.  But you don't hunt us like animals because we exist like you do elsewhere."  Dominick laughed, "And that's because Il Cane has a home here.  Even the Venatori fear her ire."

"I don't."  I claimed with a smile.  "Cari Giovanni doesn't scare me."

"Because she likes you."  Dominick laughed.  "Those big brown eyes, the hair and the finger nails painted to match.  There is a story of a boy hunter who found Il Cane.  He was relentless.  But he never wanted to kill her, so she sent her son to stall him and tell him he was close."  Dominick looked to Walker as he told the story.  "And the following year in June when the rest of the Venatori was celebrating all the new adults, he hunted her again.  And again he found her.  For four years he hunted her in June.  And for four years he found her."  He looked to me, "Did you find her this year?"

I smiled, "Two days before their Ad Aetatem Ant came to me and took me out for a drink.  He said, mother sends her regards.  She was Italy and I'd not find her this year."

"So you are telling me that you have successfully hunted Il Cane down without knowing where she is?"

"I always know where she is."  I smiled.  "I track her movements since I first found her."

"How the fuck do you do that she doesn't travel like a human?" Walker asked.

"Why would I give you my secret?"  I asked him in return.

He rolled his eyes, "Fine.  Be that way."

I grinned and looked at Dominick.  "I will see what I can do."  

A few moments later Fernando walked out with a piece of paper and some pretty illegible handwriting on it.  He handed me the paper and nodded.  "He says this is all the information he could think of to give you.  He prays that you will allow him to live a while longer."

I smiled.  "He might be useful.  Until then Dominick just don't kill him."

"I won't.  You have my word."  He offered me his hand and I took it firmly with a smile.

"See you round."  I gave Dominick a half bow.  "May the hunt be fruitful."

I heard Dominick chuckling as we left the alleyway.  We had some leads to follow.   



# Restless Nights

Walker took the paper from me and saw the contact information and the times.  He asked me, "Why did you want the times and dates?"

"We can use it to pinpoint events that coincide.  See what else The Dragon is up to other than robbing banks."

"That's a wide birth of things to cover."  Walker frowned.

"That's what Scrin are for.  We'll drop it off with Dae'lin and let them do their job.  They'll have something for us in the morning.  I have a birthday to finish celebrating."  I smiled at him.

"Sorry, I made you work on the one day off we get."  Walker said, "Why don't you let me buy you a drink."

"I have a date with a little dragon and some cake.  You can join me." I offered.

"I'll let you do your thing.  I still don't know why you care so much about all these supernaturals.  But hey whatever gets you off."  Walker held the door for me as we walked into the AU building for the last time today.  "I'll see you first thing tomorrow, Nox."

"I'll see you at 10:30.  I have an appointment at 9:30, I won't miss."  Therapy was that important.  I did not miss it - ever.

Walker nodded and headed for the elevator.  I joined him and he smiled.  "You don't have to be brave for me."  He joked.

I couldn't help but smile at the jab he was taking.  "I told you I got a hot date."

"Cake and dragon.  I remember."

Several people got on with us and when we reached HQ, Walker got off.  "I'll take this to Dae'lin.  Enjoy your night."

I nodded my thanks and got off on the Academy floor with a few other parents.  It was an odd feeling thinking I was a parent.  I didn't feel any different from before.  It was then I remembered I had a dinner date with Treec on Monday.  Great.  More dealing with people when I'd rather be talking and hanging with Sage.  I don't know why he was top of my mind but his bright blue eyes were never far from my thoughts.

I waited with the other toddler aged parents in the waiting room.  Each kid running to their parent or parents with arms wide open and smiles.  It made me wince when a small hand reached up and took mine.  I looked down to see Drake curling his fingers around my index finger.  "Hey little man.  You snuck up on me."

He grinned up and nodded.  "Nox."  A woman called from behind me and I turned around.  

"Yes, ma'am?"  I didn't recognize the woman, but she knew me well enough to call me by my first name.

"I'm Lita.  Drake's teacher.  I understand you adopted him.  I need to let you know he's already sparked. We've had a few fires today, and he seems to have mastered veiling already.  He enjoys hide and seek."

I grinned and offered Lita my hand.  "I will keep that in mind.  And we'll have a talk tonight about when veils are appropriate and when they aren't."

Lita frowned, "We will have to assign him a fire-starter teacher soon."

"Does it have to be official?  He's not Venatori.  I can train him to control his gift."

Lita nodded, "He'll need an official teacher.  However, since I know your history, I think if you can get him to control his gift without a fire-starter teacher in say a week or two, I will refrain from the recommendation."

"You'd do that for me?"  I asked.

She smiled.  "You were the youngest Cesari.  Everyone knows there is dragon blood in Cesari.  So who better to teach him than you - he will probably be closest to Cesari, anyway."

I nodded.  "I get two weeks?"

She nodded. "I'll give you two weeks.  And if you have luck with him, I might need you to teach a whole class of would be fire-starters."

"You have a class full of them?"  I asked.

"Potentially.  They are showing signs."  She smiled at me and waved at Drake. "You take care of Nox now.  He's a special person.  And he's afraid of many things."

I grinned at her analysis of me and laughed when she stuck her tongue out.  She giggled, "Treec says you have a date?"

I smiled.  "You are friends with Treec?"

She nodded, and I returned the affirmative.  "Yeah."

Lita asked, "It's not a pity date is it?"

I shook my head.  "For her or for me?"

Lita laughed, "She might pity you.  We all do."  She stuck her tongue out at me again.  "Don't hurt her."

I sighed, "Lita, I'm not looking for a mate, just a mother for my children.  If she wants more I'm not that man.  I got my eyes on someone else for the role of life partner."

"Oh really?  Why isn't she your baby mama then?"  She asked almost playfully but I could hear the disdain in her voice.

"Because he can't have babies anymore than I can."Â 
Lita blushed at my response. "Good luck with that.  Just be honest with Treec.  I won't hurt you if you do that."
I grinned, "Deal."  I looked down at Drake and smiled.  "You ready to go home?"

Drake nodded and pulled me towards the door. 

I followed dutifully behind the little dragon and when we went for the elevator I happily followed him.  Before the doors closed, I picked up the boy and held him on my hip as I leaned against the glass wall trying my best not to freak out in front of him.  "I went by your old house and picked up a few things.  They are waiting back in my apartment."

Drake lit up.  "Snoopy?  Blankie?"

I grinned and nuzzled his cheek, "Yeah, I think I got them both."

He wrapped his arms around my neck and squeezed.  "Tank you."

"You are welcome buddy."  I hugged the little dragon and couldn't help the deep breath I took with him so close.  I chuckled to myself as I noticed Drake doing the same thing.  The scent of safety seemed to be a common thing.  The little boy smelled of burning sugar - caramel would be the best description but it wasn't quite it either.  

I carried Drake down the hall to my room and unlocked the door with the little dragon. Â Footsteps fell behind me and a giggle from a baby which wasn't in my arms turned my attention to find Mia and Naya standing there watching me do my balancing act.  Mia grinned.  "See, I told you, you'd be a natural."

"Not yet anyway.  But I'm learning."  I opened the door and let Mia enter before me.  I set Drake down on the floor and motioned to his bag on the couch.  "Go see if I got what you wanted.  I can go back again if you need me too."

Drake smiled and drug the bag from the couch and sat on the floor between the coffee table and the couch.  Mia grinned and set down a small box on my counter and handed me a bag.  "Jace would have brought them by but he's stuck with a kid after school.  Parents are late. One's your birthday present, the other is a welcome to parenthood present."

"Is that a rumor now?"  I asked.

Mia shook her head.  "No.  Dorian told Jace.  And I bought the present downstairs, figuring you'd need it."  She gave me a kiss on the cheek and held Naya up to get her own kiss from me.  "We need to get home.  We'll check in on you tomorrow after your first night.  Good luck, Nox."  She called out to Drake.  "We'll see you again soon, Drake.  Soon you and Nox will come stay with us."

Drake waved, but he was he pulled things out of his bag tossing them behind him.  I took a deep breath and let it go for the moment.  I distracted myself from the mess by opening the birthday present first.  

Comic strips wrapped around the box as per Jace's tradition.  His main goal in life was making me laugh when I was a kid.  This had done the job on many birthdays.  I removed the tape so I could read them later without having to decipher the text.  Inside the box was a coffee mug with different lines measuring out when was safe to talk to me.  I set it down on the counter with a wry grin.  Jace bought me the same mug last year and the year before that.  He either forgot what he bought me or he was being lazy.  Both seemed plausible.

The other present was a book wrapped in only a ribbon.  It was an old edition of Grimm's Fairy Tales.  Not age appropriate, but considering what Drake and I were it was spot on.  I didn't have books appropriate for children in my apartment.  Drake caught eye of the book and was hopping up and down at my feet.  "Read?"

I smiled and picked him up.  "Let's clean up the mess first, take a bath and get ready for bed and then we'll read.  But I think we have cake to eat first.  And then dinner.  Okay?"

Drake nodded at me with wide eyes.  Cake before dinner was impressive.

I opened the box Mia placed on my counter.  It was the same thing she ordered for me every year.  A chocolate cake with cream cheese frosting and an orange balloon drawn on top.  It was simple and sweet and the only time I ate cake.

I cut the small cake into fourths and set one on a napkin for Drake to eat.  Then lifted the little man to the bar stool and pushed him in.  Cake wasn't complete without a glass of milk.  I poured two and Drake looked at me with concern.  "Wrong cup?"

"Messy."

I smiled.  "A straw work?  It's all I got."

Drake nodded.  The straws were kept for strange occasions all revolving around Jace visiting.  I plopped a bendy rainbow straw into Drake's milk and he grinned before he took a long sip of the cold milk.  I'd have to buy some plastic cups with straws to make life easier.  I didn't want Drake to break the few glasses I had, or to hurt himself when he dropped them.

We ate cake and drank our milk while I pulled out the makings of dinner.  Drake watched with big orange eyes and frowned at the vegetables on the counter.  "Hey. You had cake first, least you can do is try them."

He frowned, but he nodded his acceptance of the situation.  This might be harder than it looked.  Drake had finished his cake and the glass of milk was empty.  "Can you clean up the clothes mess you made?  Put them back in the bag?  Please?"

Drake nodded.  "Yes, sir."  I helped the little one down and he scurried around the couch to pick things up.

I cooked and Drake finished with his clothes - I hoped by the time I finished making a small plate of salad with grilled chicken and a homemade dressing on it.  I hoped the apples and grapes would make it more fun for him to eat, but I didn't have high hopes.  

I'd been wrong as Drake finished his food and a glass of water.  It wasn't late.  I'd eaten sooner than I'd planned, and there was little else to do in my studio apartment.  Drake was playing with Snoopy and a few matchbox cars he'd found in his bag.  The cars were driving over the glass coffee table and the magazines on top of it.  I watched him for a while before he sat down in my lap and curled up.  "Tired."

I smiled.  "I don't have a bathtub.  The sink might be too small."  We had a dilemma.  I grabbed a pair of swim trunks from my drawer and a change of clothes for Drake. The easiest way was to just jump in with him and get wet.

Drake thought it was funny when I stepped into the shower with the colorful swim trunks on.  The water was warm, and I sat down against the wall once the water was warm enough and let Drake dance in the rain of the shower head.  We washed and rinsed and splashed.  I was grateful the shower door and walls went from floor to ceiling or we'd probably have had a big mess by the time we were done.

Drake was yawning, and it was making me sleepy.  It was still way to early for me to sleep but Drake was curling up in my arms as I carried him to bed.  I laid down in my favorite spot near the middle of the bed and set Drake down on the wall side and he curled up on the pillow and blinked at me as I got up to grab the book.

I laid back down with my phone and Drake looked up at it with a smile.  I flipped the camera on and took a sleepy selfie of Drake curled up against my shoulder.  I texted the picture to Sage.

> Me  
> 646-555-4512  
> Sun, 06/24/2015  
> ****  
> Me and a little dragon.  Drake says hi.  
> 08:14 PM  

I set the phone down next to my head and pulled the book up so Drake could see the words.  I started to read, "In olden times, when wishing still did some good, there lived a king whose daughters were all beautiful..." 

My phone rang with a new Skype call.  I was concerned since I hadn't installed it, or created an account but it was Skype on my phone.  I saw the name of the call and grinned and answered it with a big grin, "Did you hack my phone?"

Sage laughed.  "No, I borrowed it when you weren't looking."

"You picked my pocket then?"  

Sage grinned at me lying in his own bed.  "It wasn't hard."

"I'm sure not, with you grabbing my ass all the time."

Sage snorted.  "I want to meet Drake?  Can I?"

I nodded.  "Sure.  I pointed the phone at Drake and smiled.  "Drake, I'd like you to meet my boyfriend, Sage.  Sage this is Drake.  He's gonna be staying with me a while."

Drake blinked up at the phone with a smile.  "Pweasure to meet you.  Nox was weading a story.  You want to wisten?"

"I'd love to listen."  Sage said with great pleasure.

I propped the phone up on the other side of Drake so Sage could see us both and I could see him and still read.  And I started again from the beginning with The Frog King.

I finished the Frog King and read Cat and Mouse in Partnership and finished with Mary's Child before Drake's eyes closed and his breathing deepened into sleep.  He'd since abandoned my shoulder and was curled around a pillow - my pillow, but that was alright, I had more.  No reason he couldn't have that one.  They weren't all identical, but I'd buy a replacement.  I knew scent was a big safety net for myself and I wouldn't deprive Drake of it either.

I reached across him and grabbed my phone and pulled the blankets up over his shoulder and crawled out of bed.  I flipped off the lights and went into the bathroom and sat down on the floor near the sink and smiled at Sage in the bright lights of my bathroom.  Sage laughed at me, "Already sneaking away from the kids."

"I didn't want to wake him up, but I wasn't ready to hang up with you either."  I smiled at him.

Sage was still chuckling at me, but he was being quiet about it.  "You called me your boyfriend."

I shrugged.  "Lack of a better word. It fits."

"Boyfriend implies that there is more than just a hook up in mind."  Sage teased.

"Yeah and?"  I smiled at him wanting to stick my tongue out at him but I didn't.  

"I've never liked those terms.  I prefer partner or lover or something more generic and grown up."  Sage was serious, but he was making fun of me too.

"We aren't lovers yet and I don't feel comfortable with partners since Walker is my partner right now."  I grinned at him.

"I see your dilemma.  I suppose boyfriend will do."  He frowned.

"I will refrain from calling you my boyfriend too much."  I said sweetly.

"Thanks.  You have a good day?" Sage asked.

"I had chocolate cake to start dinner and we'll finish it for breakfast."

"You had cake?  For dinner?"  Sage laughed.

"Before dinner.  I think it impressed Drake.  Though it set a bad precedent."  I frowned.

"How's the job going?"  I asked.

"Too busy.  Really annoying.  My brain is fried."

I wanted to see Sage, but I didn't have much to say, thankfully Sage gave me a run down on the unclassified jobs he was working.  Apparently he had classified ones too he was not at liberty to discuss.

Sage was regaling the tale of his current job when there was a knock on front door.  "One sec, Sage.  Someone's at my door I don't want them to wake Drake."

I got up with my phone held to my chest and I heard Sage chuckling on the other side.  I opened the door quietly and looked through the crack and smiled.  "It's Dorian."

Dorian looked at me with a concerned look.  I turned the phone around and showed him who I was talking to.  "Drake's sleeping."  I made sure the door was unlocked as I slipped into the hall way to talk to Dorian.

He handed me an envelope.  "Official paperwork and a birthday present," Dorian said.

"Thanks."  I opened the envelope to see the final documents and the pay increase for adopting a child.  It didn't raise my residency rate, but that's okay I'd build a loft above my bed for Drake when he was stable enough to climb the ladder by himself at night.  Or I could move up into the loft myself.  We'd see.

Inside the same envelope was a ring.  I pulled it out and Dorian explained its meaning.  "His mother wanted him to have it.  It's a family heirloom.  To be passed down to his life mate.  She won't be able to give it to him, so she asked that you do it."

"All right.  But I don't have any place safe to keep it."  I said.

Sage spoke up from the other end.  "We can get you a safe deposit box at the bank downstairs."

Dorian nodded.  "I can hold on to it for you.  When you can get that box downstairs you can put it in there.  I know it's not something you can do until this Dragon thing is taken care of though."

I sighed.  "It's much more than a dragon thing now I think.  But right now we are dealing with the dragons."

Sage asked, "The wolves too?"

I nodded but Sage was still pointed at Dorian on the phone.  I turned it as I spoke, "And the vampires too.  It's bigger than we know."

Dorian nodded.  "Be careful, Nox.  War will happen regardless of your actions, possiblyÂ because of your actions."

"I know.  I'll be careful."

Dorian smiled. "I know you will. I will let you get back inside.  Have a good night, Nox.  If you need help with the boy, let me know.  I have experience with wayward sons."

I grinned.  "Thanks, Dorian.  I will.  Night."

Dorian waved at Sage on the phone, "Night, Sage.  Don't keep him up too long."

Sage chuckled, "I won't, sir."

Dorian laughed.  "I hope he rubs off on you."

I stuck my tongue out at Dorian.  He laughed as he walked down the hallway towards his room.  He wasn't too far away, but he had a much bigger apartment.  He was older and held more status despite not completing his fathering duty.

I opened the door and shut it behind me and sat down at the bar in the darkness of my apartment while Drake slept.

"I should go to bed.  I don't want to wake him up and I'll be back up soon, anyway."  I sighed.

Sage frowned at me through the phone.  "Call me if you wake up, Nox."

"I don't want to wake you up."

Sage adjusted the phone and whispered, "Please.  I ask that you call me.  I can't be there to help, so let me at least help calm you down.  Please."

I frowned.  "It'll be 4am."

Sage smiled, "I know and I'm okay with that.  You aren't alone.  I want to help you."

"All right," I agreed.  "I will call you when I wake from my nightmares."

Sage smiled.  "Good.  I will hope not to hear from you, but I know I will."

"Night, Sage."  I blew him a kiss, and he laughed but returned the gesture.  I hung up the video call and put my phone on the counter to charge for the night.

I changed then crawled into bed grabbing a pillow from across the bed and closed my eyes.  I thought of Sage's blue eyes, the scent of jasmine and lavender but the only thing I could smell was burnt cookies which made me smile as I placed my hand on top of the little dragon's head and ran my fingers through his hair.  This wasn't going to be easy, but I was looking forward to it.

Sleep came and so did the dreams.  It wasn't just dreams of the blue eyed monster, there were red and orange.  The first strike landed against my back and I felt the sting in the real world and my eyes shot open.  

I wove air, earth, fire and water and fed it to the new scar that would form.  I could feel the skin knitting together and I grimaced in pain.  It wasn't that it hurt, but it was unnatural.

I got up out of bed and got a drink of water before glancing at my phone.  It was 3am.  I'd woken before time.  I remembered my promise but while I had a moment, I set a new ring tone and text alert for Sage's number.  Then I hit call and waited for the other man to answer.

It was the fourth ring before Sage picked up groggily, "Nox?  You okay?"

I nodded. "Yeah.  Didn't get through the sequence of the dream tonight.  I woke up on the first lash."

I heard Sage sit up.  "You hurt yourself?"

"Skin  broke.  I healed it, no new scar will be there."

Sage sighed. "Except the emotional one."

I laughed into the phone.  "I think those will be there even if I wasn't hurting myself in my sleep.  I'm okay though, really."

"I know you are.  You feel better?"

I smiled.  "Yes.  I like talking to you."  I sighed.  "Raising a kid will throw a kink in my schedule."

"What would you be doing now?"  Sage asked.

"I would go for a run.  Or lift weights.  I could do yoga or bodyweight in the living room." 

"You are a health nut, aren't you?" Sage teased. 

"I am. I'll do that then make breakfast early I guess."

"What time is breakfast?"

I chuckled. "6?"

"I can make that and still get to work on time." Sage said.

"Then I will see you at 6."

"Six then.  I'm going to bed again.  You get all sweaty and chef-like and I'll see you soon. Night, Nox."

I smiled.  "Night, love."

I heard Sage chuckling as I hung up the phone. 

I sat down on the floor and began the breathing exercises in child pose that started off my morning yoga.  It was good to de-stress and detox.  I should have done this last night.  But it's to late for that now.

I moved on to my hands and knees and took a deep breath and lifted my chest and rear into cow pose I let out the breath and tucked my chin into my chest and rounded my back into cat pose.  I could feel the stretch in my back.  

My routine was always the same.  I found something that worked to remove the nightmares from my system.  Table top to downward dog into knee to nose pose.  Downward dog into flip your dog and then to a side plank and returning to downward dog to begin a regular plank.  I minded my breathing, focusing on nothing more than my body working through each pose.  

It cleared my mind as it stretched my body.  Plank lowered into four-limb staff pose.  Upward-facing dog was next and I could feel the stretch again in my legs and back.  Returning to downward facing dog.

Breathe in.  Breathe out.  I stretched though more poses and returned to child pose to begin again for a second and third time before my body felt cleanses of the nightmares.  I rolled over on to my back and stretched out on the floor and stared up at the dark ceiling.  I would have to rearrange my schedule to get everything in.  I wasn't looking forward to the change.  But I needed to go for a run as much as I needed to lift weights, and practice yoga.  It was part of the regime that had kept me sane for the past 10 years or more.  It was important.  I needed it and with a child and more on the way - I needed it more than ever.  Children were anything but predictable.

I checked the time on my phone and I still had plenty of time to shower and cook breakfast before Sage would arrive at 6.  I sat up and looked across the room at the sleeping form of the little dragon in my bed.  A loft would work for him even now.  We'd just have to put on a rail so he didn't fall out unexpectedly.  I made mental sketch of things and I would see if I could have it built sooner rather than later.  

I didn't turn on the bathroom light as I opened the bathroom door, I could shower just as easily in the dark and that's what I did.  The water was hot against my skin and spot that should have been tender under the heat wasn't.  It had healed near completion.  

I spent 30 minutes in the shower devoid of any thought but the warmth of the water and the desire for Sage's arms to be wrapped around me.  I don't know why I'd fallen so hard for the man with the blue eyes.  He wasn't the most gorgeous man I'd seen.  He wasn't the funniest or even the smartest.  But his smile drew me in.  His sapphire blue eyes said I was home.  I knew that was my brain speaking more than finding these things true.  I knew I formed attachments quickly when I chose to let someone in.

Jace and I had been distant friends until his mother made us play together.  We weren't friends, we were just roommates.  But when I agreed to let him in he was my best friend.  My only friend for a long time.  Jason Hill was like a brother and it had been just as instantaneous as it was with Sage.  Except this time, Sage was not just a friend.  

If I'd been older when I connected with Jace things would have moved into the sphere Jace had wanted it to for so long.  But change is difficult and losing my best friend and brother is the worst possible thing for me to imagine.  Jace made me sane.  He was part of the whole piece of who I'd become.  

If I'd lost him in a bad break up, then I'd have been lost.  I love my best friend but not in the manner he had wished it.  I was thankful when he fell in love with Mia.  Mia is my savior in that sense.  It's still a touchy situation, but most of the time Jace and I are fine in our relationship.

I was growing too connected to the blue eyed boy who intrigued me from the start.  It had taken me a while to remember the night I'd first met him.  When I was dancing and screwing his friend.  I had liked him then, his big blue eyes, his sweet smile.  I had liked that he watched me over his friend.  I was the center of his attention that night and I had thrived on it.  Maybe in my subconscious I knew who he'd been when I'd hit on him.  Maybe it was why I hit on Sage at the club when Dr. Silas was bothering me.  All I know is that I wanted more than I had with him, and I was willing to work for it.  Margo would be proud of me.  Hell, I was proud of me.  Maybe I was growing up.

I was quiet while I got dressed. I pulled on a pair of boxers and a pair of black coated jeans with a black t-shirt that said 'normal people scare me'.  I pulled on my gray hoodie and socks and started making breakfast.

A sun-dried tomato, mozzarella and basil frittata was on tap for the day and I added some Italian sausage to the mix since I was cooking for three - two and a half, I doubted Drake would eat a full persons worth at his age.  But I had never fed a baby dragon before.

I hated adding carbs to my breakfast, but I still had a half the loaf Mrs. Sheila gave me and figured it would make a great toast.  I could roll with some changes.  As long as I ate well I was happy.  Even if it was skewed from a normal Monday morning.

I checked the time.  It was 5:34, and I knew Sage was likely on his way.  I felt butterflies in my stomach as I finished baking the frittata in the oven.  As I was pulling out the frittata there was a knock at the door.  I moved the pan to the hot plate to answer the door.

I knew it was Sage no one else would be up at this hour.  Both Jace and Dorian hated early mornings.  I opened the door with a bright smile and saw one in return.  Sage grinned at me, "Hey.  Fancy meeting you here."

"Drake's still asleep, I was just finishing up."  I stepped aside and let Sage in.  He walked in past me and his shoulder dragged along my chest.  When he was inside I closed the door and put my hand on his chest stopping his progress.  We stood just past the closed door his shoulder pressed against my chest and my hand in the middle of his.  We were smiling at each other like we were mad men and his blue eyes sparkled with desire.  I bet mine were dark with it.  I leaned closer and whispered, "I want to kiss you."

Sage chuckled and put his hand on my waist, "You don't have to ask."

"Actually,Â I do."  Sage quirked an eyebrow at me in question.  "You told me to wait on that."

"Ah."  Sage laughed again catching himself and biting his bottom lip to silence himself.  

I leaned in and pressed my lips against his tentatively but Sage was pliant and I pushed a little harder and licked his lips.  His lips parted and my tongue entered his mouth caressing his lips.  Sage's hand found its way to my head, and we were deepening the kiss.  My body tightened low, and I let the small sound escape my lips.  I had wanted this for far too long.  I kept my hand on his chest afraid if I moved it we'd be writhing on the couch in moments.  I wanted it to last forever, this moment.

Sage pulled away when his stomach rumbled.  "I guess I'm hungrier than I thought."  He winked at me.  "Feed me, Seymore."

I laughed and didn't try to hide it.  Drake was getting up in a second, anyway. "All right.  Can you pour some milk for me and Drake and whatever you want?  Glasses are in the cabinet next to the fridge."  I pointed to which side so it wasn't a guessing game still.

Drake was not so easy to wake up.  I tapped him before I had to shake a little harder.  His groggy little orange eyes opened, and he grinned at me.  "It's time to eat."

"Cake?"

I laughed.  "This is the last piece of cake we have, so you can have it for breakfast, or you can wait to have it for dinner tonight?"

"Cake!"  Drake grinned up at me.

"All right.  Go to the bathroom and then wash your hands.  We have company, okay?"

Drake nodded and looked around me to see Sage waving back at him.  "Hi."  Drake got up and ran into the bathroom and didn't shut the door.  Privacy was not something a three-year-old needed.

Sage sat down the stool away from the wall and I wrapped my arms around him and nuzzled against his neck.  I took a deep breath and smiled.  "I could stay here forever."

Sage laughed.  "You aren't afraid of being a bad influence?"

"I will be a bad influence even if he doesn't see my sexual preferences.  And this is doing no more than he will see anywhere else.  It's not like I'm even kissing you.  I could bite your neck."

Drake popped out with dripping hands.  "Like a vampire?" he asked.

"I could but I wouldn't be feeding on him, just playing."  I smiled, and I pulled away from Sage to help Drake up into the stool next to my boyfriend.  This was a pretty picture.

I served three plates and pushed one to each of them and leaned on the other side of the counter looking at the two new men in my life.  Big change, but something I wanted.  Something I needed.  How things had changed.

"I think I need more room here to feed all the people in my life."  I grinned across at Sage who was happily eating away at his breakfast.  Drake however was staring at me with a frown on his face.  "Am I forgetting something?"  I asked him.

The look on his face screamed traitor.  "Cake!"

I laughed. "You mean this cake?"  I slide a slice of cake to Drake and he dug in right away like I'd take it away.  I looked at Sage with smile.  "You want the other piece?"

Sage shook his head.  "This is good.  I'm good."

I laughed and set it down in front of us with two forks.  "If we don't eat it, he will."  Drake's eyes went wide, and I added, "If Sage won't share it with me, you can have it for dinner, but this is the last of the cake for a while,Â all right?"

Drake nodded and finished his cake and drank almost the whole glass of milk before he started in on his frittata.  

"You really start with dessert?"  Sage asked.

"If I eat desert, yes it's usually first.  It's my rebel side.  Convention says dessert is last, so I ate it first to piss people off.  It became a thing when I started this life style.  When I realized that what I put in my body meant more than what a Venatori did.  My metabolism isn't like theirs.  I'm much more human than I am Venatori.  But I'm not human either, magic, super senses, the ability to heal almost any wound without the help of my ability, magic is just a few things that set me part from humans.  Being raised by Venatori changed the way I would see the world.  Being an orphan does that too.  I learned to cope with my strange fence straddling world.  Just like I'm sure you did.  And what Drake will have to do."

Drake laughed, "You talk too much."  He pushed his plate across the bar.  "More please."

I had been wrong.  He would eat more than one person.  I gave him another slice of the frittata and slide it back to him.  I had finished mine during my explanation.  Sage had completed his too and was contemplating the chocolate cake in front of him.  I picked up a fork and took a small piece and offered it to Sage and he stared at the fork then at me with a smile.  "Fine."  He opened his mouth and took the offered morsel.

I took a piece and ate it myself, handing Sage the other fork.  Drake pouted.  I grinned at him, "Sorry man.  Maybe next time."

Sage cut a piece of the cake and plopped it on to Drake's plate and leaned over and whispered into the little dragon's ear, "Eat it quick before he sees."

I rolled my eyes but turned to get a cup of coffee.  "Coffee?"  I asked Sage.

"God.  Yes. Please."  Sage drawled out like he was dying.

"Sugar? Milk?  anything?"  I asked.

"Black is fine."  Sage grinned.  "You don't have any of that, anyway."

"Sure I do.  I just don't drink it that way most of the time."

Sage laughed.  "Too many calories?"

I nodded with a grin.  "I indulge on Starbuck's coffee every so often with some of their high calorie deals but not often.  I like my coffee to taste like coffee."

Sage grinned.  "That's good to know.  So if I wanted to spoil you with things you don't normally eat, what would you suggest.  Milk shakes don't seem to be your thing, chocolate cake, over the top coffees don't seem to make you splurge."

I shrugged.  "Chocolate will usually win in any form.  Pumpkin pie is a favorite and a regular treat.  Bonnie makes a great pumpkin pie."

Sage laughed, "So you are the reason pumpkin pie is always on the menu even when it's not fall."

I nodded. "That and steak."

Drake hopped out of his chair and ran to the bathroom to wash his hands again.  He was pulling at his pj shirt and trying to get dressed.  I watched him as he walked into the coffee table and glared at it with one orange eye peaking out of the button hole.  "It's easier if you unbutton it."

By the time he had the shirt off he was grinning and pulling out a black t-shirt and jeans from his own bag.  "Twins," he declared.

Sage had disappeared behind me and had washed the food dishes and I turned to watch him in my kitchen.  He looked back at me with a smile, "You cooked."

"I can do that, ya know?" I smiled back at him thenÂ wrapped my arms around his waist and kissed his neck.  "Thank you. I'm going to help Drake get dressed."

Sage nodded, "All right."

Drake sat on the floor tugging on his tiny jeans and I picked him up and sat him on my lap and helped him.  I tickled his little belly and stood him up while I button the jeans.  "Ain't you handsome?"

He beamed from ear to ear.  I instructed, "Brush your teeth.  The blue one is new."

Sage sat down next to me, "You keep new toothbrushes out for company?"

I grinned.  "Yes and no.  Jace stops by and crashes once in a while. It was time to replace them, so it's just not been used.  I'll have to put another one out for Jace.  Maybe you'll earn a toothbrush too."  I leaned my shoulder against him and pushed softly.

Sage laughed and pushed back.  "Or maybe I'll just use yours."  Sage was watching my reaction to the tease.  

I took a deep breath, and he laughed.  "Not a good idea?"

"No."  I frowned.  "I mean, it's no different from sharing spit when we kiss, but I dunno just something about it."  I shuddered.

Drake came out carrying my toothbrush and handed it to me,  "Brush, mister."

I stood up and took Sage's hand.  "We better listen." 

I opened the mirror behind the sink with a press against the side and pulled out a green and red toothbrush, "Which one you want?"  I asked Sage.

I picked up the toothpaste while he grabbed the red one.  I plunked the green into the toothbrush holder for whenever Jace came by again.  This was the most toothbrushes I'd had in my bathroom at any one time.  

It wasn't awkward with Drake standing over us watching us to make sure we brushed our teeth well.  Sage tried to fake it by not using toothpaste which earned him a scolding from Drake with the waggling index finger telling Sage no, no, no, no.  I didn't get in trouble, it was a true miracle.

Sage stopped at the front door and frowned at the watch on his wrist.  "I gotta catch the train to be in my chair by 8."

I nodded.  "All right."  I turned to Drake, "Come say bye to Sage, he has to go."

Drake hugged Sage's legs and Sage picked him up for a better hug before he patted him on the head and Drake was off towards the bed.

"Thanks for breakfast."  Sage said as he grabbed my waist and pulled me close.  "It was delicious.  And I loved the company."

"I enjoyed it myself."  I smiled as I leaned my forehead against his.  We kissed again softly.  My knees felt weak and my hands were hanging awkwardly against his hands.  When we parted I was trying to catch my breath without being dramatic about it.  

Sage laughed at me and kissed my cheek. "Call me when you can, Nox."

I nodded. "Okay. Oh. Hey.  I have a date with a girl tonight around 6.  You want to be here?"

Sage frowned.  "Won't that be awkward?  I mean for everyone."

I shrugged.  "Yeah.  But I don't want you to think I'm hiding this from you.  I want you to meet her.  If you don't like her, then she can't be the one.  She could be in my life for a long time."  I gave Sage a peck on the lips softly.  "And if you are going to be in my life for a long time, then we need to all be on common ground."

Sage shook his head.  "No.  I think you need to work out the details with her, then I can meet her.  You can still say no, it won't work right?"

I nodded. "I guess.  I've never had to do this before.  Any of it."

Sage smiled. "I'd love to have dinner with you.  And I am glad you want me to approve of your baby-mama.  But we just started this, Nox.  Don't rely on me for this. This is strange enough as it is."

I nodded and felt the nagging feeling of rejection tinging the edges of my senses.  "I'll call you later."  My voice had fallen flat and Sage heard the change and the hurt feelings.  I opened the door and waited for him to leave, but he stood where he was watching me.  

"It means that much to you?"  He asked.

I shook my head.  "No.  I wouldn't do this if I didn't have to.  I'll drop it.  You have to get to work Sage.  Don't be late because of me."

"Nox..."  Sage stepped closer and I looked at the floor.  "I'll come to dinner if it'll make you feel better."

"No, it's all right, Sage.  I don't care about dinner.  I've been toldÂ no before."  

Sage took my chin between his fingers and lifted my eyes to meet his.  "What's wrong then?"

"Nothing."

"Don't give me that bullshit.  You can't stop talking about mundane things.  You will not clam up when it matters."  Sage's voice held a quite sort of rage behind it.

I tried to look down but Sage made me look up at him with slight pressure on my chin.  He asked again, "What's wrong?"

"You reminded me I become attached too quickly."  I glanced at the time on the stove, "You will miss your train."

"I'll be late."  He said closing the door with a loud click.  "I'm here for the third day in the row."  Sage frowned.  "I don't do one night stands, Nox.  This is not a ploy to get in your pants.  I think we've established the fact that we could have both done that several times already and gone our separate ways.  You've met my family.  I've met parts of what you consider family.  Fast yes?  But I'm here.  I'm a little weirded out because you have to sleep with some girl just to have a baby." 

"You think I'm not?"  I sighed and pulled away from Sage then walked over to my dresser and pulled the envelope out from under the folders on top of it.  I took the document out.  "This is the contract we signed when we became adults.  Every Venatori has one."  I pulled the last page from the packet and I found a pen on the coffee table and signed the paper then handed it to Sage.

I watched his face while he read it - It clearly stated that in the event I did not bear a child in the first five years I wouldbe fined 50% of my stipend for a year and for every year until I bear the first child.  After the tenth year and failure to produce my two heirs a lump sum is fined.  My signature on the line indicated they should garnish my wages when my five years was up.

Sage stared at me as I plucked the paper from his hands.  "Make you feel better?"

"You said you still had a year left."  Sage sounded confused.

"A year I plan on spending with you.  And if you aren't comfortable now with me sleeping with some girl to make a baby, what makes you think when we've been together for six months or nine it will get any easier.  They might as well start now."  I opened the door again.  "Drake, come on, let's go."  I turned back to Sage.  "You missed your train, if you hurry there is another one in three minutes."

Sage pulled the paper from my hands and grabbed my wrist, "You'd do this for me?  Because I can't deal with it?"

"Why wouldn't I?  Money isn't going to make me happy."  I grabbed the paper, but he refused to release it.

He smiled at me.  "But I will?"

"That's my hope."  I stared at him waiting for him to just let things go so we could move on and get over this.  He wanted to dwell, and I was over it now.

Sage pried my fingers from the paper with ease.  He smiled as he tore it in half.  I couldn't see the look on my face but I'm sure I was wide eyed and open mouthed wondering what the fuck he was doing.  "Meet with the girl.  If she works for you, I'll meet her.  We'll decide what to do then.  Okay?"

Drake grabbed my hand and tugged me out the door.  "Wet's go."

Sage took my other hand and tossed the paper into the garbage bin near the door.  "I have a train to catch."  Sage wandered towards the stairs and he pulled me into the stair well and once the other side of the door he kissed me hard.  

I could have collapsed into his arms but I stood my ground and walked down the stairs with both of them holding my hands.  Sage grinned at me, "We okay?"

I nodded.  "We were never not okay, Sage."

"You were mad."  He said.

"I was afraid Sage.  I wasn't mad.  I am terrified of being hurt.  My life has been nothing but people I love deserting me, and the people who are supposed to care don't care enough."

Sage frowned, "Dorian cares."

"He does now.  But it wasn't always the case.  I grew on him and Dae'lin.  I was just another kid at first when I needed parents I didn't have them."  I shrugged.  "It doesn't matter.  I survived.  I'm just a little fucked up."

Sage laughed, "A little?"

I leaned over and kissed his cheek.  "This is the Academy.  You can catch the elevator here."

We kissed goodbye in the stairwell and parted ways at the elevator. Drake whispered up at me, "I wike him."

"Me too, Drake.  Me too."



# Monday Madness

Drake and I walked hand in hand to the toddler facility and I bent down in front of him and I smiled.  "Drake.  You need to do me a favor okay?"

He nodded and I wove the pattern of a veil.  "Do you see this?"

He nodded.  "Pwetty."

"It is.  But you can't make in school okay? I know it's funny when people can't find things, but it's not nice okay?"  I said softly.

He nodded.  I smiled.  "We will work on it at home okay?  Me and you.  We can play hide and seek tonight after I get home okay?"

Drake smiled wider.  "K."

I then wove a pretty ball of fire.  "Do you see this one.  Not the fire, the pretty parts behind it?"

He nodded.  I stretched it out so the fire grew near transparent so he could see the threads of elements below.  "If you see these at any time.  I want you to think about something happy.  You might not be the one doing them, but I want you to think of something happy okay?  Like your mommy's hugs, or cake.  Something that makes you happy.  This will help keep everyone safe alright?"

Drake nodded.  "You keep me safe."

"I will do my best.  Can you do these things for me?" I asked.

He nodded emphatically.  "Yes, sir."

I grinned.  "Good boy.  Either myself or Dorian will come get you okay?"

I felt an elbow on my head and knew exactly who was using me as their resting pole.  "Hey Jace.  Have you met Drake yet?"

Jace knelt down and offered his hand to Drake.  "Hey Drake.  My name is Jason.  This lug here is my best friend and brother."  He held Naya up in her cute little dress.  "And this is Naya."

Drake waved shyly at them.  "Mia and I'll grab him.  I'm sure Dorian's busy.  He doesn't need a toddler running around.  We can stay at your place till you come back."

"If I'm late Jace?"  I asked.  "You guys can't crash with me.  I don't have room."

"If it get's late will drop him off with Dorian.  But let us watch him.  He can help us with Naya."

I looked to Drake.  "Would you like to hang out with Jace and Mia tonight."

"More cake?"  he asked.

I laughed.  "Probably not."

He nodded.  Just as Lita showed up for class.  "Come on, Drake, let's go."  She held out her hand to him and he walked to her and calmly went in.  She looked at me, "It go alright last night."

"Swimmingly."  I said with a bright smile.

I got a quick cuddle with Naya and then went on my way.  I stopped in with Dae'lin to see if there was any news first.  She was on the phone and I stood outside her office waiting while she finished up.  

Walker passed by with a frown, he glanced at his watch, "I thought you said 10:30ish."

"I am.  My appointment is at 9:30.  I was just checking in on things before I went up."

"Ah.  There has been nothing definite yet and it can certainly wait until you get back.  Maybe they'll have more information."  He said with a smile.

"If there is nothing then I'll head up and see you in a little more than an hour."  I headed for the stairs.

Walker yelled after me.  "You got that date with the fat girl tonight?"

I sighed but nodded my head.  "Her name is Treec."  I hurried to open the door and started up the stairs to the Infirmary where I would find Margo's office.

It hadn't moved in the 15 plus years I had been going to see her.  And the decor had only changed slightly.  Inside the waiting room were several single comfortable chairs sitting around a single coffee table with magazines and a bowl of wax apples.  In the far corner was a fake tree with apples strategically placed in the branches.

Her office smelled of fresh cut apples and was very homey feeling.  The fabric of the pillows reminded me of the classic picnic blanket with the red and white gingham print.  Megan smiled at me from her desk.  "Morning Nox.  Dr. Silverman will be with you shortly."

I smiled back at her.  "How's Gretta?"  I sat down.

"She's wonderful.  I'm so happy to have her home now.  It was a bit of a rough ride there for a while.  Greg is loving staying home with her these past few weeks."

"I bet he is.  I'm glad she's doing better."  Gretta was born with a faulty heart and had to go through surgery to fix it.  It was rare for Venatori to have birth defects but it was prone to happen.  It happened more when families were too close to one another.  No one thought Greg and Megan had been close, but apparently they had been close enough or something else had played a part in it.  Either way Gretta would be in and out of hospitals for the rest of her life much like I'd been.  Even if she were completely healthy after these surgeries.

Megan asked, "I heard you were adopting a little one?  Last night was your first night."

I nodded.  "Rumor sure travels fast."

Megan laughed.  "Mr. Vega had Dr. Silverman signing paperwork for you to expedite the adoption.  I'm sure she'll tell you all about it,"

The door to Margo's office opened and a man in a ragged sweater and thinning gray hair with round spectacle perched on his hawk like nose walked out.  I smiled, "Mr. Brown."

He smiled a nearly toothless grin at me, "Nox.  A pleasure."  Mr. Brown had been going before me for as long as I could remember.  I didn't know why he was coming here, and Margo never shared his reasons to me even when I would pester her endlessly about it.  I didn't know who came after me, they were always late.  So much so she was always scheduled for two blocks.

When Margo was back to her door I stood up and entered her office and sat down on the blue couch.  She sat in the wicker chair that reminded me of those you saw on beaches.  Her office was supposed to reflect that calm place on the beach.  It smelled of tropical forest and there was even a small waterfall sitting on Margo's desk.  The beach was not calming for me, but the room was.  Margo had been making it calm before the beach became an unsafe place for me.

Margo pulled out her yellow pad and wrote down the date and my name and looked at me.  "Good morning, Nox.  How are things going?"

I smiled. "All in all well.  Though I'm sure I'm going to run out of time today."

She laughed.  "Okay.  Busy week?"

"No more so than others.  A busy weekend.  I met a boy. Two actually."  I started.  She smiled at me to continue.  "You know about one already.  He and I get along okay.  I think we'll be good together.  Ironically it's the least of my worries. I've wanted this for some time.  I just didn't expect to start with a three-year-old."

"How's Dr. Silas treating you?"

I rolled my eyes.  "She's why I met the other boy.  I was ditching her on my birhtday outting with Jace and used him to show her I liked guys by hitting on him.  He apparently knew who I was but I didn't remember him.  We hit it off, danced all night.  He too my protection leaving me his card.  Mia texted him in my stead and we started chatting.  I've had three meals with him in the past three days and seen him once outside of eating arrangements. He's met Dorian.  And I've met his family."

"That's fast Nox."  Margo frowned.

"I know.  We discussed it.  The relative speed of this.  He's not opposed to it.  He doesn't want a one night stand.  But I'm terrified he'll leave.  My nightmares have changed.  It's not just the red eyes anymore, there are blue and orange ones joining in on the terror.  But that isn't all.  Last night when the blue-eyed demon hit me I woke up.  I felt the lash against my skin and I woke up." 

"Why do you think you are having the change in dreams?" Margo asked.

"Same reason I always do.  Because I'm afraid of Sage hurting me.  My mind processes it the same way it processes all my fears. Despite the fact that it's not the same kinda hurt."

Margo nodded. "You've spoken to your new friend about moving too fast.  What else have you talked about?  That isn't something you'd share lightly is it?"

"He stopped by the night after I went on mission with Walker when I lost three hours of time."  I started.

"Wait.  You lost three hours?"

"I must have fallen asleep.  I saw Garret after getting back.  He touched me.  I was in flight mode and I had taken the stairs three at a time.  And I sat down to calm down.  When Garrett and I were talking Sage sent me a text.  I heard another one go off and it must have woken me up.  There was three hours between texts. I didn't dream.  I didn't fall asleep but I had to have."

Margo was furiously making notes on her yellow ledger.  When she looked up she said softly, "If it happens again, notify me immediately and we'll begin studying it.  Hopefully it was just a one off event.  Blackouts are not good Nox."

I took a deep breath and tried to calm the rising anxiety.  Margo prompted me to continue, "Tell me what else you and Sage have spoken about."

"I told him about my nightmares.  He's seen my back."  I didn't look up to see her reaction.  "I let him touch it.  More than once."  

Margo put her hand on my knee to get my attention, "That's big."

I nodded.  "I told him some of the bad shit in my life.  He took me home to show me his shit life." A curt laugh escaped.  "He was raised by wolves quite literally.  He's Agent Danny Morgan's son."

"The same Agent Morgan you've worked with and the one who reports to Adrian Sheridan?"

I nodded, "One and the same."

"You are falling for a wolf Nox?"  Margo sounded concerned.

"He can't be a wolf.  He's a path.  It's why he bounced from home to home as a kid.  He was a terror on electrical things - lamps, tvs, computers broken because he's near."  I shrugged.  "We've talked about Dr. Silas and her agenda.  He tore up the paper that would garnish my wages."

"Why did he do that?" 

"Because I signed it.  He didn't like the idea of me procreating by law, so I did the only thing I could.  He tore it up, told me we'd deal with it.  I told him money wasn't going to make me happy.  But he might."

Margo smiled.  "I'm proud of you.  A few years ago you would have just ended it with him.  Much less get started at all.  A significant other and a son, all in the same weekend.  A very busy weekend Nox."

I smiled.  "And a new partner.  And a headache case.  War is going to happen.  I'm not sure anyone can stop it.  The dragons are stepping on wolf and vampire toes more so than before.  The Dragon is targeting human financial places and probably a list of other things.  Dominick wants me to keep an eye out on the dragons.  I'm sure I can get word to Ant to see if he's seeing the same thing in the vamp areas."

We talked for the rest of the hour about work, and my feelings about various other things going on.  All the big stuff having gotten out of the way in the first twenty minutes of the session.  By the time the hour was up I needed a glass of water.  Thankfully when I stepped out of the office Megan was holding up a bottle of water for me.  "See you next week Nox."

"Bye Megan.  Kiss the baby for me."  I grinned.

"What?  Greg will be so jealous he didn't get a kiss."  Megan laughed.

"You can kiss him too."  I raised the bottle of water to Megan and Margo in farewell and left the empty office to start working.


I headed to the elevator to take it down to Dae'lin's office but I didn't make it past the stairs.  Walker was standing against the wall near the door down with a smile on his face.  "There still isn't enough info.  Wanna hit the ring for a bit?"

"You sure you want to be caught hanging out with me?" I teased Walker.

"I'm stuck with you till this Dragon thing is taken care of right?"  

I nodded.  "I guess I'm stuck with you too."

"So we might as well be friends?"  Walker offered his hand.

I took it with a grin and nodded.  "Sure why not.  But yes a spar sounds great."

"You talk anything interesting with the doc?"  Walker asked.

"The usual.  All my murderous tendencies and such."  I grinned at him.

"I'm surprised she hasn't turned you in with all the death and mayhem you wreak on the world."

"Patient/Doctor confidentiality for the win."

Walker laughed.  "Anything I should worry about?"

"No.  Not really.  Mostly dealing with childhood issues, continual nightmares and OCPD.  The OCPD causes anxiety and depression when it gets out of hand.  But we have pretty much gotten that under control."

"And your fear of heights."  Walker laughed.

"I'm afraid of a great many things, heights is only one of them.  Needles are one I haven't conquered yet.  Clowns are a bit out there too.  I avoid them."

"Seriously?"  Walker laughed.  "Clowns.  Now I know what to get you for your birthday."

"Oh please do.  I love throwing fireballs at them."  I smiled.

"Shit, forgot about that."  

"You forgot I can throw fireballs?"  I asked.

"I'm rethinking this spar."  Walker actually sounded  frightened.

"I will not use fire.  I promise.  In the ring I mostly use just air."  I assured him.

"Don't want to hurt us non-magnus huh?"

"It's more so I don't get hurt from you.  You hit like a truck and I've had my share of broken ribs and noses because I couldn't get out of the way fast enough."  I confessed.

Walker laughed.  "I can imagine.  I had my own share too."

Once we'd changed and warmed up so neither of us pulled a muscle the gym had emptied out a little more than when we started.  This one was not used as often as it was actually in HQ, most people preferred to use the ones in the residences or the Academy level ones, the equipment was better in those small gyms.  But we didn't need equipment.

The ring was just a circle tapped out on the matted floor like a wrestling ring but the Venatori didn't just learn wrestling moves, or boxing, or any one martial arts.  We learned everything.  What we retained was our own familiarity with our body.  It was a free-for-all for the most part.  Some people pursued karate, or kung-fu.  Others liked straight up boxing.  My father liked MMA style fighting.

I didn't follow any one path.  I used what came easily, what kept me out of the way of their feet.  It was what I would have to do if I went head to head with a supernatural creature anyway.  They could easily crush me.  My ability to create patterns quickly was my only saving grace.  

Walker and I started circling one another.  There were a few people standing around watching us.  They started the typical male rooting for their friend - which wasn't me.  They thought I cheated.  

Walker attacked first tiring of our circling.  He was a blur of hands and feet and I had to throw up a rod of air to keep them from hitting me.  Walker backed off and the rod disappeared.  He shook his head, "Most Magnus can't think that fast."

"You've never seen me fight."

A voice from the far end of the gym sounded, "Most magnus don't use their ability to fight."

I sighed at my father's voice.  Walker took advantage of the distraction and was once again attacking me.  I blocked him with my own hand and legs - avoiding getting hit in the core or head regions.  I padded my arms and legs with air so that the force of his blows didn't crack a bone.  Walker was not holding back.  I was grateful he wasn't but a little miffed too.  

Walker backed off again when I landed a round house against his shoulder.  He laughed.  "He attacks!"

My father stepped into the ring without any shoes on and beckoned both Walker and I to take him on.  Walker grinned widely and I could only sigh.  This was going to be a lesson in working together.  Neither of had worked with partners before, now we had to work together.  

Walker grinned at me, "You remember yesterday with Aaron?"

I nodded.  "Alright."  We started circling each other and Walker attacked first on my father's right side.  Which left me on his left - his weaker side.  I moved in quickly but my father saw me and he turned in time to catch my hand in his.  He blocked Walker's advance with his leg and tried to sweep us both from our feet in one motion.  

I stepped into my father and put my hand on his chest and a bar of air under his knees and I pushed backwards.  Walker kicked at my father's chest and Kai tumbled backwards on to his back over the bar of air I'd created.

I offered my hand to Walker and he shook it with a wide grin.  "We work well together."

"It would seem that way."  Walker offered my father a hand up.

"I wasn't expecting you two to work well together."  Kai said slightly dazed.  "New partners and all."

I was sure that wasn't the only thing my father was thinking.  He figured we'd be at odds with one another, and we'd probably end up fighting each other, not working together.

"Next time won't be so easy."  Kai said with a smile.

I looked at Walker and he smiled back.  He turned to my father with that same grin and said, "You're on."

We started circling again.  This time I took the offensive.  I used a combination of kicks and fireworks to distract my father.  Walker took the advantage and side swiped my father and he once again was on his back.  I offered my father my hand and he frowned up at me.  "That's hardly fair."

"You can do the same thing.  It's earth and fire."

Kai frowned, "I can't use them both at the same time."

You don't have to.  I wove visible patterns for everyone to see.  Earth first. "The base is just earth - it's explosive but not potent enough to do any damage if you don't hold it in your hand."  I tossed it in the air and light it on fire with a simple weave.  And small sparks flew into the air like a fireworks outside.  It made more noise than anything and it was distracting but it wasn't going to hurt anyone if you were careful.  "It's what I did.  I just did it faster."  I repeated the maneuver at my normal speed and it looked nearly instantaneous.  "I didn't cheat. If I were fighting a vamp I would have thrown a little more spark into it to blind their light sensitive eyes and I wouldn't worry about where I threw it."  

"It won't work more than once though."  Kai said flatly.

"You'd be surprised at what a loud sound will do multiple times particularly if they think you have a gun."  I smiled.

"So you just use tricks to fight."

"When I have to fight yeah, Dad. I do.  I don't have super speed or super strength.  How am I going to take down a wolf or a vamp if I have to go hand to hand?  I'll get my ass kicked.  So I don't fight them.  If it comes down to it then I will."

"You can't win an honorable fight like that."

I laughed.  "Sure I can.  I ask the rules.  Typically they say - there are no rules.  So I can weave a rope of air and strangle them till they pass out, or break their neck if I so choose.  You think it's cheating, but I asked.  It's not my fault they don't know what I'm capable of."

Kai rolled his eyes.  "An answer for everything?"

I shrugged, "Again?"

Kai nodded.  "I think Walker and I should go against you."

I shrugged.  "Okay.  If you think you can both take me."  I was being cocky I knew it.  I really didn't expect to win.  But both my father and my partner decided that I was being too cocky and came at me at the same time.  I had a wall of air between me and then in a matter of seconds and they both collided.with it.  I backed up and threw a bar of air at them and they flew on to their backs.

Walker laughed as he lay on the ground staring up at the ceiling.  "I knew he'd not let us close, but I figured we'd be pounding air until we bruised our hands."

Kai sat up with a frown that creased his forehead.  "You think this is funny?"

Walker nodded as he sat up himself.  "Yes, sir.  He knew he didn't have a chance.  He did what any of us would have done, used our abilities to our advantage."

I offered Walker a hand up and he took it gratefully.  "Remind me not to piss you off."

I smiled at him and offered my father a hand.  He stared at it then up at me for a few moments before taking it.  "If you'd done that in my day you would have been suspended."

I chuckled.  "I wouldn't have done it in school.  You forget I'm a grown man now Kai.  I'm not some little boy looking for a lesson in how great a hunter you are."  I turned and walked away.  "That's probably enough for now.  We have work to do."

Walker nodded and headed back into the locker room with me.  I heard my father's heavy footsteps behind me.  I always got looks when other's showered with me.  But they were the ones looking not the other way around.  I knew to mind my own business or get a beat down.

My father and Walker both watched me.  It would have been uncomfortable with their eyes on me but I knew they were both making sure I didn't take a peek at what they had to show the world.  Like I gave a fuck how well they were hung, or how hot they were underneath all those clothes.  I smiled at the thought of the one person I wanted to see naked.  Sage wore clothes that were not revealing enough, his jeans fit well and showed off his hot ass, but his t-shirts were too lose and the dress shirts hid more than they revealed.  It left a lot to the imagination.  

Getting dressed always posed an interesting situation some men liked to yammer on about things others liked to get out of there fast.  I was the latter I didn't need to sit there and talk with naked men and compare dick sizes.  Or share stories to make us seem bigger.  Thankfully Walker dressed quickly and was combing his blonde hair back as I finished tying my Nike's.

Walker looked at me and laughed, "You really don't do anything with that mop?"

I smiled as I ran my fingers through it and let the longer hair from the top fall over my Venatori tattoo.  "Doesn't need much. Unless you want to wait for 20 minutes while I style it just right so it's perfectly messy and doesn't move."

"Seriously?"  Walker laughed.

"No.  But it isn't something I do after a workout and typically only when I have plans to go out.  I figure we are hunting today, the less product in my hair the less mess when I'm exhausted."

"No eyeliner?"  Walker pointed.

"Fat chance.  Unless it bothers you that much?" 

Walker shook his head.  "Be my guest."

I applied a new coating of eyeliner.  The one from earlier wasn't washed away completely leaving behind more a smokey feel but I liked the crisp dark lines.  Walker watched as I applied a new fresh line.  It must have been intriguing watching a guy put on make up.  I watched him blink and then turn around when he realized he was watching me put on make up.

My father stood in the aisle between the lockers frowning.  "You have to do that here?"

"Would you rather I do it at the sink where everyone here can watch?"  I asked.

Kai frowned.  "Why can't you just be a normal boy?  Stop with all the antics and the profession of your sexuality."

I smiled.  "Because then you would feel comfortable around me and we can't have that."

"It's not about me boy.  Everyone would feel more comfortable if you just acted like a normal man."

"Kai. I am not a normal man.  I am half human, half venatori.  I don't fit in there, I don't fit in here.  My mother and I should have both died.  I am Cesari.  There is nothing about me that is normal.  So what?  I like men.  I like women too.  If people would mind their own fucking business when it mattered maybe I wouldn't be so fucked up now.  I like who I am.  I like the colored hair and the nail polish.  I like the eye liner and lip gloss.  Be grateful, father, that I don't go the whole gambit of make up.  I did once upon a time.  But that's too much fuss to be pretty.  I don't want to be pretty.  I want to feel comfortable in my own skin.  This."  I held up the eyeliner pencil. "Makes me feel comfortable because it makes people like you uncomfortable.  I could dress in drag.  Wear a skirt and high heels.  It's never been my thing but if it would make you feel more comfortable I'll give it a shot.  Actually, no I won't."

I got up and left the locker room and walked out of the gym.  I heard footsteps behind me as Walker caught up to me outside in the hall.  "Sorry man.  I figured your dad would be cooler about you, since his own son is ya know..."

"I am his own son too.  He blames me for Nick.  Even though Nick was gay before I ever came along."

Walker laughed.  "That's right you two got caught kissing."

I smirked, "We were more than kissing, Walker.  We were going to have sex if we hadn't gotten caught.  We were on our way to a broom closet when our hormones got the better of us and we were found kissing in the hall with our hands in each other's pants.  He's my half brother, we could have avoided that entire scenario if someone had told us we were related."

"Are family dinner's awkward now?"  Walker chuckled as he asked.

"Only for Kai.  Nick and I are better friends now because of it.  We both were deceived.  We both like men.  We've gone out a few times to find guys.  But our tastes are drastically different.  Besides he's got a beau now anyway.  Sweet boy a little too girly for my taste though."

"You don't like girly boys?  Aren't they prettier?"

"I like pretty boys, but girly boys like fashion and do the whole hand thing and talk with higher voices and to me seem a bit fake."

"You mean they seem gay?"  Walker laughed.

"I don't mind a guy who is all out there.  I just don't like fake."  I said.

"Aren't you fake?"

"Are you asking if I'm faking things?  Or am I trying to be fake?"

"Both I guess."

"It's not fake anymore.  I am who I made myself.  I like me."

Walker laughed.  "Not many people do."

"I know. I'm okay with that too.  I'm an arrogant prick at times I get it.  I understand I make people uncomfortable.  It's all that hey look here, so that they don't look where I'm vulnerable."

Walker nodded like he understood and he was lost in his own thoughts.  Maybe we were more the same that we both had initially thought.



# Bombs

We made it to Dae'lin's office and I knocked politely on the door, but there was no answer.  I peeked in the side window and saw she wasn't there.  "No Dae'lin." 

Walker started looking and pointed, "She's in the fish bowl with your dragon lady."

"This should be fun."  I said.

Walker and I went into the glass walled conference room. Dae'lin didn't turn to look at us but Naomi's orange eyes looked up and she gave me a half smile before turning her attentions back on Dae'lin.

The raven haired Venatori was short in stature but she didn't become head of the field hunters by being soft and small.  Her personality made up for her height.  "Sit down gentleman."

Walker did as she asked and took a seat next to her.  I didn't I walked around the table examining what was really going on in her.  The dragon had been hurt, possibly tortured.  Dae'lin was holding her in loose bonds of air.  I frowned, "Let her go.  She's not going anywhere."

Dae'lin turned her brown eyes up at me and stared at my defiance.  "Let her go." I demanded.

Dae'lin shook her head.  "It's safer this way."

"Let her go. Dae'lin."  I was probably over stepping my bounds and Dae'lin thought so too as she stood up and stepped into me.  

I smiled down at her.  She had scared me once upon a time.  Now she was only my boss, she couldn't do much more than write me up.  Firing me meant I went down a level and possibly couldn't hunt.  That would be a bad thing, but really how do you fire a man when there are only so many hunters in the organization.

I sat down ignoring Dae'lin's display of authority.  "Let her go.  It's the last time I ask."

Dae'lin's voice was quiet and red hot with anger.  "You never asked."

I turned to Naomi and wove a razor sharp line of air and snaked it between the dragon and her bonds.  I pulled and the weaves Dae'lin were holding sliced in half leaving a vacuum and there was a small pop as the weave broke completely.  "I said let her go."

Dae'lin stared at me in raw fury.  "She will attack."

"She will not attack.  She had not attacked any of you who were not provoking her.  I can go look at the tapes Dae'lin.  I guarantee you she was on her best behavior until someone taunted her.  I don't even have to be here to know it's true."

Walker looked a little guilty and I frowned.  "She's a person just like you are.  Treat them as such and they won't fight you so bad.  She knows she's dead.  At least let her die with some dignity."

I turned back to Naomi, "Your son slept well last night.  He enjoyed the cake my friend brought me.  I hope he won't be disappointed when cake isn't for dinner every night."

She smiled at me and I continued, "What is Dae'lin asking you about?"

Naomi slid the paper across the table.  I recognized the handwriting and the times and dates and the bits of information were familiar even though I hadn't read it all.  I knew they were asking about the Dragon's plans.

"I see your name and number here.  Valentino contacted you we know this.  Do you recognize any of the other numbers?"

She shook her head.  "No, but they already have the names the phones belong to.  I don't know any of them."

"So why are we in here?"  I asked.

"Because they don't believe me.  All dragons must know all other dragons."

I laughed. "Most Venatori know most venatori.  But dragons are solitary creatures - rarely taking mates out of fear for their hoards.  I believe you."

"What's the problem here Dae'lin?"  I turned to look at the woman who was glaring daggers at me.

"She can't know nothing about them."

"Why not?  Do you know anything about Glen Hill?"  I asked.

"I know he's the father of your best-friend."

"Do you know Robert Hill?"  I asked.

Dae'lin looked at me like I was asking her a trick question.  "Robert Hill is my best friend's great-grandfather.  I met him once when I was six.  He passed away the year after that.  Did you know that?"

Dae'lin frowned.  "No.  I did not."

"Do you know every human in New York City?  Do you even know one human in New York City who doesn't work in this building?"

Dae'lin shook her head.  "So it's possible she doesn't know these people.  Drop it Dae'lin.  Put her back in her cell and let her wait her trial and pay for her crimes in peace."

I stood up and took the piece of paper with me.  Walker followed me out.  I turned to see Dae'lin stalking out of the fish bowl and shutting the door behind me.  She grabbed me by the arm and attempted to drag me to her office like the child I had once been.  Old habits died hard, but I wasn't going to put up with it.  I dug my heels in and she turned around with a huff.  "If you want to do it here. Fine with me."  She didn't stand on her tip toes but her she puffed out her chest and made her stance known.  "You will never do that again.  Are we clear?"

"I will never do what again?"  I asked.  I had done a few things she would be pissed at.  I wanted clarification on it.

"All of it. Nox.  You may not be a boy anymore but if you ever countermand me in front of anyone ever again I will hang you out to dry."

"So you want me to let you treat people with disrespect and hatred because you think you are better than them?"  I asked.  "You want me to go pull up the footage outside the conference room?  From the look on Walker's face a moment ago he and a few others were taunting our dragon friend.  It's no fucking wonder they hate us.  We think we are better than them.  We preach harmony but we don't practice it.  You tie her up in bonds of air because you fucking can.  Did she attack you Dae'lin, or just some dumb fuck who was treating her like a dog they think she is?"

"You will not talk back to me."  Her anger rose up and I could see fire brimming around her just waiting to pop.  

"I am not five any longer Dae'lin.  I will not be treated like a child.  I'd rather be demoted than be treated like you treat me.  I'm no longer your student.  You cannot manhandle me."

Tiny ribbons of translucent fire threaded itself around Dae'lin and I frowned.  She was losing control.  She only ever lost control around me, that was how often I made her angry.   "I wouldn't have to manhandle you if you obeyed me."

"If you had asked me to come to your office or even ordered it I might have followed you.  Instead you choose to grab me by the arm like some stubborn child.  You treat me like a child you will get childish reactions from me, you damn well know this."

The fire grew larger but only those who could see the patterns even knew the impending danger of the anger seething from the leader of the field hunters - which meant I was the only one who noticed.  Her anger grew and the heat from the threads was making her sweat - small beads trickled down her forehead and she absently wiped it away.  Walker had started fanning himself several feet away from where we stood.  I could have said something.  I probably should have, but I knew telling her to calm down would only make it worse.  So I let it build up to dangerous levels.  Instead I spoke calmly and with a cool voice, "I am asking you for a reassignment - officially.  Give me and my problem self to some other low level administrator and let me be their problem."

Dae'lin stared up at me like I was asking for something completely strange and extraordinary - people transferred all the time. "Why would you ask that?"

I sighed, "Because apparently you and I don't work well together."  I gestured to the air around her and she looked around noticing for the first time the flames that were threaded around her.  In that moment of realization Dae'lin regained her control and stared at me open mouthed.  "I won't give you to someone else.  They will try to make you be someone you aren't."

"I'd like to see them try, Dae'lin."  I said defiantly.

"Nox.  Don't ask that of me."

I frowned.  "Then stop treating me like I'm still your student.  I'm equal to everyone here.  And you tried to drag me off like some petulant child.  I don't have a problem with you yelling at me in public.  But I will not let you treat me like I'm five."

Dae'lin turned around and headed to her office.  "My office.  Now!"

I sighed but I followed her to her office.  Walker followed in my wake but he hung back.  He didn't want to get yelled at.  I smiled at him as I closed the door to Dae'lin's office.  She was already sitting behind her desk staring at her computer screen.  I stood by the door waiting her instructions.

"I'm sorry, Nox.  I have no excuse for my behavior.  You make me so angry."  The anger was still present, but so was the remorse and the sorrow for times long since gone.

"I won't apologize for what I did in there Dae'lin.  You didn't need to keep her tied up. You know what they do to those I bring back.  What did you expect her to do when people taunt her and kick her like a dog?"

"I know.  And I know you feel every ounce of pain they feel while they are here.  I am always surprised empathy was not one of your tested abilities."

"It doesn't take a magical ability to feel for others, Dae'lin.  I know what it's like to be treated like shit.  To be on the receiving end of the bullies here in the Venatori.  They have rights.  The Clandestine Providence doesn't say we are better than they are.  We are the police.  We have to obey the laws too."

Dae'lin sighed.  "That is why you can't be under someone else.  You'd be slapped a desk job every time you spouted your views until you rode that desk permanently.  Every kill you failed on would be a mark against you.  I know it seems that way now, but they listen now.  They've actually let a few go with probation.  I was surprised when Il Cane took a fledgling in personally."

I smiled.  "Il Cane didn't take him in.  Ant did.  He killed Casey's master for making children vampires.  Ant felt responsible for the death of that middle school teacher and his family at Casey's hand. Casey is a good barista at the Starbucks in the Night Life building. Armand says he might even promote him to night shift assistant manager."

"Nox.  Teach Walker well.  He's a good hunter.  He's not like you, but he could be."  Dae'lin looked up at me and frowned.  

"Why did you pair me with him Dae'lin?"  I asked.

Dae'lin picked up her phone and sent a text before she answered me.  "Walker was in Nebraska.  He was hunting a rogue wolf.  The wolf turned out to be a 15 year old girl who was bitten by what authorities called a rabid dog.  No one suspected she'd turn.  The wolf in question skipped town months before she turned.  She ravaged her birthday party guests killing one and infecting three others."  Dae'lin sighed, "He killed her without hesitation.  A bullet in the chest.  It was a clean kill if she'd been human, but she wasn't.  He watched the girl suffer.  She'd been in wolf form and when she shifted back to a girl Walker lost it.  His handler said he almost put a gun to his head.  He needs to see there is more than one way to do this.  Tell me what you would have done with this girl?"

Halfway through the story I heard the door behind me open and I could smell Walker's cologne before he shut the door behind him.  Dae'lin had continued uninterrupted, and as she finished the story I could feel the tears welling up in my eyes.  I knew how Walker felt.  Hell, I'd been there myself on my first hunt.  "Did she attack him?"

Dae'lin shook her head.  "No, they had trapped her, she was cowering in a corner when he shot her."

"I'd have calmed her down.  Talked to her humanity and brought her out of it.  At the very least I would have kept her there until she shifted back.  I'd have given her to the local pack, told the alpha the story and seen that she got the help she needed.  I'd have given him the three names of the infected as well.  He'd be in charge of them too.  She'll always remember that first kill, but she didn't have to do it again."

Dae'lin asked, "Would you have done it with Michaela there egging you on?"

"You are asking me if I would have killed her because Michaela was ordering it?"  I asked.

Dae'lin nodded. 

I said. "I don't know.  Michaela never made me do anything I didn't want to do.  She said if I failed, it was on me, not her."

Dae'lin acknowledged the man behind her, "Walker do you want to ask anything?"

"No ma'am."  He stepped into my peripheral vision and was looking down at the ground.  I put my hand on his shoulder and squeezed then it my hand fall back to my side.

I looked at Dae'lin, "Do you have anything else? Walker and I have some work to do."

Dae'lin shook her head.  "No.  Let me know what you find out."

I turned and opened the door and headed towards the elevator.  I hoped Walker followed and he did.  I didn't hear the door shut behind us.  I pressed the elevator button to go down and we waited in silence.  If Walker wanted to talk I'd listen, if he didn't I was good with that too.  But it was his mission.  His problems.  I wasn't going to push.  I knew from personal experience that was the best way to make someone shut up about it.

The elevator doors slide open and everyone disembarked.  We got on and I pressed the button for the ground floor.  Walker asked, "Where we going?"

"Address 

#1 on the list.  I know it." 

The first few floors we rode in silence.  Walker broke it with a whispered question, "You aren't going to even ask about it?"

I shrugged.  "If you want to talk about it, talk.  If you don't that's okay to.  I'll listen either way when you are ready."

"I didn't know she was 15 when I shot her.  Hell I didn't even know she was a she until she shifted."  Walker confided.

I didn't mention the fact that wolves usually have visible genitals, that wouldn't really help matters, but the age thing was completely not his fault.  "No one could have known she was only 15 from looking at her."  I reassured Walker.  "Shit happens.  From what I get from the story and the questions Dae'lin asked, your handler was pushing you to shoot first and ask questions later.  It's not your fault."

Walker shook his head.  "It was.  I pulled the trigger.  Would she have had a good life?  Could she have had?"  Walker sound generally concerned over the idea that he hadn't done the right thing.

"She could have.  Most victims who survive the change, which she obviously did lead full and normal lives except for three days out of every month.  It's rough at first, sometimes they have to cage the fledglings, but most of the time an alpha can control them so they don't attack humans."

Walker sighed as the door to the lobby opened and we stepped out.  He was lost in thought as we headed into the afternoon air.  It was bright and I wished I'd had my sunglasses with me.  

I lead us to the subway station to get to our next destination.  The train rattled into the platform and Walker didn't say anything until the train started moving again.  "How do you know when to not shoot first?"

I smiled as I sat across from him.  "I don't shoot at all unless they are trying to kill me.  Most confrontations can be handled without violence.  It's easier if you have contacts of the species you are hunting to help out.  I know all the Alpha's here in the City.  I may not have a personal number for them all, but I know who to contact in case I need it.  Same goes for the vampire Prince's.  I don't like Desmond much, but if necessary I can get him involved.  But more importantly I know people even Desmond will listen too.  Even the CCB has people you can call in every city in the world."

"How the hell did you make those connections?"

I smiled.  "I walked the streets.  I listened.  I asked questions.  I made people trust me.  The rogue wolf leader I knew from when I was a kid.  I met the son of Il Cane shortly after I finished my first hunt.  I met Desmond through a baby vampire who was ghouling his friends.  Thankfully we got his friends clean, but Desmond taught the vamp to behave himself.  I don't approve of his methods, but he's not dead dead so I'm okay with it.  Dominick, I met through Liam who I hunted because he went nutso on a train while high on some drug or another and partially shifted."

"Just don't shoot first ask questions later.  Ask the questions before you even get in that situation."  I recommended.

"How do you know we won't get into a shooting match now?"  Walker asked.

"I don't.  But the place we are going is a safe haven.  Violence is kinda prohibited.  The owners will shoot you no questions asked."

Walker laughed.  "Go figure."

I stood up as the train came to a stop and we left the train car to head up to the street level.  We were in the heart of vampire territory now.  Vamps weren't up yet, still daylight.  Though there were a few daywalkers in New York, but not many.  Most of the New World daywalkers lived in Sanctuary - a place you have to travel through the shadows to get to.  But that's what the rumors were and I'd never actually seen it.  Though Ant said it was real - his father lived there.  I believed Ant.

The building we walked up to was a typical residential apartment building.  But most of the windows were blacked out.  Vampire kiss' tended to use this joint more often than other species.  But it was safe for anyone who needed it.

The front door was unlocked and I pulled it open with ease.  "Wow.  Didn't expect it to be easy to get in."  Walker said with awe in his voice.

"It's a safe haven, can't lock doors for that."  The hall way was empty but the room at the end of it was bustling.  It was a common area for the building - a tv room and game room rolled into one.  It reminded me of the common area in the dorms back at the Academy.  But we didn't go there.  We took the stairs up to the third floor where our would be dragon accomplice was billing his cell phone too.

I knocked on the door.  We waited.  I knew we'd have to find the manager.  Thankfully I had an in here too.  "Let's go find the proprietor of this lovely establishment."

"You know way too many people."  Walker interjected as we walked down the stairs to the common room.

"I don't really know that many people.  I just know the right places for supernatural activity."

"Does your father?"

"I have no idea.  He hunts differently."

"Shoot first, asked questions later?"  Walker asked.

"Yep."  We stepped into the common room and nearly every eye in the room turned towards us.  Only one pair didn't.  I headed for him."

The man sat in a chair and stared out at blank wall.  He looked lost in whatever thought he was having.  I waited for him to acknowledge me standing next to him.  

He asked, "What brings you Venatori to my humble abode?"  He sounded like an old vampire in the creepy 50s films.  

"Are you putting on a show for my friend?"  I asked.

A small smile split his lips and his fangs showed through.  "Maybe."

"Don't scare him too much, please."

Armand stood up in that graceless motionless way that old vampires could sometimes.  Armand blinked at us gray white eyes of the blind.  He was blinded by holy water when he was a boy.  He was the only daywalker I knew who didn't live in Sanctuary.  "What can I do for you my boy?"

"We need to get into an apartment on the third floor.  The Dragon is using the occupant for some reason and I need to figure out what that is.  Valentino has been delivering messages here from him."  I said.

"Follow me."  We followed.

Armand didn't knock he didn't use a key, his hand passed through the door and he unlocked it from the other side.  It saves having to have a master key I supposed.  I'd seen vampires do similar tricks before.

Walker stared in open amazement.  "Damn."

"It's not so fun when you are whisked away in the shadows and wind up in Italy or something.  Gut wrenching not cool."  I knew that from experience.

Armand smiled as he opened the door and let us walk inside.  It was a studio apartment and it was clearly being used by someone making bombs.  There was no hiding it.  There were chemical bottles on the table with C-4 wrapped in paper bags waiting to be used.  Even Armand gasped.  "This is worse than violence on my premises."

"Do you know who lives here?"  Walker asked.

"Emerson. Gideon I think is his last name."  Armand said.

"So same guy who owns the phone."  Walker noted.  "What's he bombing though?"  He walked over to the table and looked at the papers lying on it.  Underneath all the printed bomb making instructions was a map of the city's infrastructure.  Walker cleared the map of obstruction and saw several x's marked on it.

Armand was looking around the apartment.  While we examined the map.  I asked, "Do you remember what it was that Naomi said The Dragon was doing?"

"Ruining human society."  Walker said.

"No, she didn't phrase it like that.  She said something about money and power.  What if she didn't mean the kind of power that you get from taking over human society.  These are x's.  I think are power substations.  Blow one up and half of New York City goes out.  Blow them all up and the City will be dark.  It will cause chaos until they are repaired."

Walker sighed, "We can't hit all these locations quickly.  We need more hunters."

I nodded in agreement.  "We need hunters who can remove bombs or at least contain them.  Fire Magnus and fire squad members would likely be the best ones to get out here."  Walker put his finger on the nearest X.  "This is the one I would do last.  We should go here.  We don't know how long he's been a this.  But power hasn't gone down yet."

"I'd put them on a remote detonation and do them all at the same time."  I said.

Walker looked up at me. "Have you thought about blowing things up before?"  He grinned.

"No.  Nothing so mundane.  I once planned a war scenario in our Strategy class in the Academy using New York City as a basis for my world take over.  It's what I did."

Walker raised an eyebrow, "What else did you do?"

I smiled.  "You think someone took my ideas?"

"No.  Well maybe, but what else would you do to take over the world."

"My goal wasn't to take over the world.  It was to disrupt it and by taking out every substation in New York City, the stock exchange would be down for an indeterminable amount of time and if not relocated quickly chaos would ensue.  We were paired in teams.  Another team took out all the power plants in the United States using coordinated attacks."  I grinned, "The teacher didn't much like our plans.  Said it was too far fetched.  And this after the coordination of 9/11."

Walker nodded.  "She used your demonstrations as examples of excellent planning and great foresight two years after you took it."

"So we go here before he takes out the substations then.  Coordinated attacks."  Walker grinned.

"Alright."  I called Dae'lin and told her the plan.  She sent teams of hunters out to the other locations marked on the map.  We would stop this plot by The Dragon.  But we needed to find him.  And I didn't think these little things were going to get us anywhere near him.

Armand stood outside in the hall and frowned at us as we stepped outside closing the door behind us.  "I will need to alert the enforcers of this."

I nodded.  "I understand.  Vampire territory.  I need Emerson alive if possible.  I don't know if Tony will do as I ask since he's breaking vampire law not dragon law at the moment.  But please tell Tony things are bigger than just one dragon blowing things up.  He knows how to find me if necessary."

Armand nodded.  "Il Suo Compagno will heed you Venatori, as do we wall when you ask, upon penalty of Del Figlio."

"Cari send's Ant to do her dirty work now?" I asked.

Armand laughed.  "No.  Il Cane gave New York City to Del Figlio.  He is Master here."

"Why did she do that?"

"I am nothing but a pawn in the night.  The queen does not consult with the pawns.  Her knight however makes peace with the Venatori.  He was rewarded.  The Prince is not happy Del Figlio rules now."

"Desmond always thought he could control Cari.  He's never been successful in controlling her son."  I smiled.  "Thank you for your assistance Armand.  How can I repay you?"

Armand laughed. "Has my price ever changed young Venatori?"

I shook my head and offered Armand my left wrist.  He took it in his hand and turned so he could feed easier.  Before he bit, he chuckled, "One day it will be from your neck I feed."

"Unlikely, Armand.  The last vampire I let bite me there ended up in my bed.  I do not think you swing that way."

Armand laughed as he pierced my wrist with his fangs and sucked.  The euphoria of a vampire's bite was the reason that vampires had been romanticiszed throughout the centuries.  They were killing machines, but the sex and the allure of the bite is what drew people to them.  There were religions based around the bite of a vampire.  The Eternal Chruch was the most famous.

I closed my eyes and thought of my blue eyed boy.  I would not think of bedding Armand - not when I had something better to look forward too.

Armand withdraw from my wrist and was chuckling at me.  "That was a first, my young Venatori."

"What was?" I asked.

"A glimpse into your mind.  You never share so deeply.  Del Figlio would have blushed."

"Ant can't read my mind while he feeds Armand."

"He was pretty in your mind.  Those blue eyes, I've seen before in your head. Dreams or visions I couldn't tell, but before today they were there."

I frowned.  "Are we even?"

Armand nodded.  "We are.  I love the magic in your veins.  I can survive for days upon this one feeding."

"Glad to be of service Armand."  I gave him a flourishing bow before heading for the stairs.

Walker fell in beside me with a curious look.  But he didn't start speaking until we were blocks away.  "All those Italian names means Vampire heirarchy right?"

I nodded.  "Il Cane is the Council's Enforcer -  Cari Giovanni.  Il suo Campagno is her mate - Antonio Giovanni.  Del Figlio is her son Anthony Giovanni.  Ant is Master of New York City it seems while Desmond is Prince."  

"Aren't they the same thing?"  Walker asked as we headed for the substation closest to Emerson's apartment.

I shook my head.  "No. And yes.  They are technically the same thing.  But you know there are three kinds of vampires right?"  Walker nodded so I continued.  "Cursed vampires don't have masters or princes.  They are usually fairly weak but they are usually the ones we hunt.  They fall neither under the Council or the Elders.  Masters of cities or regions are Primeval - Cari and now Ant being the exceptions to that rule.  The Elders allowed them control of a region because they are Masters in their own right and while not technically living vampires they share their blood.  A Prince is what the Council sets up for the embraced bloodlines.  They are who are supposed to control the cities vampires.  New York City is unique that it has all three types of vampires.  Places like Denver and Dallas the Embraced vampires run out all other vampires.  San Francisco and Detroit are run solely by Primeval vampires they let lesser vamps in they only kick out those that would hurt their power."

"How do you know all this?"  Walker asked.  "It's not things we learned in the Academy."

I smiled.  "I told you I listen.  Everyone wants to talk about themselves.  All you have to do is ask."

"Why do you let vamps bite you? Aren't you afraid you'll die?"  Walker asked.

"The first time I got bit yeah.  It wasn't a pleasant bite, it was meant to kill me but it didn't.  The second time I offered the son of Il Cane my blood as a peace offering.  We ended up in bed despite his orientation.  He can't control the bite's allure as well as he should because he is primeval, but not primeval.  He like Cari is one of a kind.  Ant was born a vampire, but because he was born of an Embraced vampire with all the bloodlines including primeval he can't walk in the daylight, another of the side effects of his birth is he can't control the power of his bite.  And I don't have a problem with men and when I pushed the seduction farther he went with it."

Walker laughed.  "So you turned a straight guy gay?"

I shook my head.  "No. I believe the term is heteroflexible."

Walker and I continued walking he sighed.  "There is so much I don't know."

I laughed.  "And why would you know anything about alternative ways of life unless you were curious about them."

"How did you know?"  Walker asked.

"That I like men?"  I asked.  Walker nodded. "My first hard on was for a guy.  But my first sexual encounter was with a girl."

I nodded towards the direction we needed to.  "The substation is around that corner.  Split up or stick together?" I asked.

Walker looked around.  "We'll find him faster if we split up.  Meet up here in 20 if we can't find him?"

"Sounds good."  I went left and Walker went right.  We moved silently like we'd been trained.

The substation was encompassed about half a block with lots of high voltage signs all over the fence.  It was easy enough to hope the fence even with the barbed wire at the top, but I didn't have to, there was a hole the size of a man burnt into the fencing.  As if that wasn't enough of a clue to what did it we were definitely on the right track.  The fence had already cooled, but that didn't mean anything really.

Before I went in I sent Walker a text

> Me  
> 646-555-4512  
> Mon, 06/25/2015  
> ****  
> He's been here.  Fence is burnt/melted.  Stay alert!  
> 11:32 AM  

I didn't wait for a response.  Either Walker got it or he didn't.  We both knew our job, and I trusted Walker to be safe and do his.  He knew we needed Emerson alive.  I hoped he knew anyway.  I didn't think Dae'lin had paired us together just because Walker needed help hunting in the city.  

The substation was mostly electrical equipment and I really had no idea about most of it.  I only knew that if I wanted to blow it up I wanted something central and that would cause the most destruction.  So I wound my way towards the middle of the network of cables and capacitors and whatever else was sitting in the substation.

It was eerily quiet.  The gravel under my feet was the only sound.  My heart rate was steady as was my breathing.  This was where I lived.  I thrived on the hunt.  It was dangerous.  I loved the hunt.  It was where I felt most alive.  

I rounded the corner and saw a figure slip between a row of boxes.  I moved slowly, each footstep carefully placed so the gravel wouldn't shift beneath my feet and make a sound.  I pressed my body against the last box before the figure had turned down and I wove a reflective surface with air and water.  I could watch without being seen.  

A man dressed in black stood near one of the large conduits.  I glanced around me and knew that we had to be in the center of the construct.  It would yield the most damage.  On the other end of the corridor of boxes I saw Walker move into a closer position.  I watched as Walker continued to get closer.  He wanted to take him down physically.  No guns were drawn, he wasn't going to kill.  I wondered if Walker had ever gone up against a dragon before.  

I got closer.  Emerson was busy applying the C4 to the conduits and connecting wires and preparing his bomb.  I watched Walker and he pantomimed a distraction and wrapping the dragon up.  I nodded my ascent.  I understood.

Walker tossed a rock away from him and Emerson turned in that direction.  I wove air in front of Walker and myself and then in one quick weave I engulfed Emerson in a vaccuum.  He started to gasp and struggle for breathe and I then gagged him with earth and air and let him breath again.  I bound his legs and when he tried to move he fell to the ground face first.

I stepped out from my spot.  "You had to feel the bonds on your feet Emerson."

Walker came up to him too.  "What did you do to him first?" he asked.

"I sucked all the air out of his area.  I didn't want him to breathe fire."

"Human form Dragon's breathe fire?"  Walker asked.  It was a question I actually got a lot.  

I laughed.  "You saw the scar on my leg right? Dragon fire from a human form dragon."  The look on Walker's face said it all.  It was a mixture of wide eyed surprise and shocked horror and neither one of them was wrong.  

We weren't taught in the Academy that dragons in human form could breathe fire.  My theory on that was because you didn't normally survive dragon's fire.  It was like napalm, once it got on you it burned through your clothes and into your skin and to the bone in minutes.  Water makes it spread like oil and it's so hot you can't fan the flames out, it eats everything in it's path.  But I'm not a normal hunter as I've said many times already, my ability gives me a different advantage.  I suffocated the fire with earth air and water and I still had a functioning leg thanks to my quick thinking.  Courses would be reviewed and the information was added, but Walker didn't benefit from the knew knowledge.  Red tape and all that.

I smiled at him, "Tell me about it."  I squatted down in front of Emerson who'd now had managed to sit up.  His face was a mass of cuts and scrapes from falling into the gravel of the substation.

"I'll ungag you if you promise not to spit fire at me."  He glared at me and I shrugged.  "Suits me just fine.  We'll take you in and you can wait for your trial.  I'm sure The Dragon's just going to love you for getting caught."

His eyes went wide at the mention of The Dragon.  We helped the man up and we let him walk.  "We can do this the easy way or the hard way."  Walker added.

Emerson shook his head.  I dropped the gag and Emerson stretched him mouth from the restraint.  "If I talk he'll kill me."

"Attempting to blow up a substation is gonna at minimum put you in prison, but since you are a dragon you fall under the Clandestine Law, and we get to sentence you.  You know what Venatori to do people who disrupt humanity right?"

Emerson nodded.  "I want a deal."

I laughed.  "This isn't a cop show.  We'll take you in, but you will talk to us with or without a deal."

We took our dragon in.  He was meek and cooperative.  We called in our bomb squads and they'd take care of the c4 and the other explosives he'd planted.  We removed everything but the clothes on the man's back before we left with him back to HQ.  We even gave him the address where he made everything.  I called Armand while we walked back.



# The Rest of the Plan

I walked a small distance behind Walker and Emerson but we didn't walk much farther when I saw Emerson take a deep breath.  I saw fire pull in from the elements around him and build in his chest.  It was like watching a slow motion reel in the movie theater.  I threw a wall of air between Walker and the dragon about to rain hell upon my partner.  The second it solidified the fire was beating against it.  And in the next the dragon was lying on the ground, his neck wrenched to the side with a weave of air and his green eyes were glazed over and fading into their dragon form.

Walker turned and looked back at me.  His eyes were wide and his jaw fell slack.  I smiled and wove a veil around us as we dealt with a dead dragon.  I gave Walker a small smile and knelt down next to Emerson and sighed.  "I don't think we'll get any information out of him now."

Walker just stood and watched as I crafted air bonds to carry the now dead dragon to head quarters for proper treatment.  I would have handed him over to the dragons, but since he was a criminal he was Venatori's to do with as they desired.  His body would likely go in the incinerator.  But you never knew what they would do.

By the time we got back upstairs to headquarters I was drained.  My magical ability wasn't a determent to me unless I was forced to take a life with it.  It pulled life from me each time I defended myself with it.  It required balance.  And it looked like this mission was going to take a toll on my ability.

Walker was walking slowly by my side as we took the stairs all the way to the top.  He wasn't panting or even breathing heavy, which was a testament to Venatori strength and stamina.  We reached the landing of the hunting offices and Walker put his hand on my arm before I reached the door.  He smiled and said, "Thank you."

"There is no need to thank me.  I would have done it for anyone in the same position.  It's my job to protect the innocent."  I smiled back as I leaned against the wall for support.

"You look like shit," he said.

"Killing takes a while to recover from in a literal and metaphorical sense."  I couldn't explain to Walker something he wouldn't understand.  I couldn't explain Life essence to him because Life was not something we were taught, yet it still lived in the patterns we created every day.  It was how I could heal.  And killing destroyed life essence, I'd hurt myself in the process of taking Emerson's life.  And my body needed to recover from it just like any other injury.  It was all about balance and I had disrupted it.

Walker frowned. "Why do you do it then?"

I shrugged.  "It's faster.  I deal.  And also why I don't kill often."

"A gun would have worked just as easily."  Walker's conviction echoed in the stair well.

"How do you explain a gun shot with no body?  Or stray bullets?  I can control every aspect of my ability.  I'm more comfortable with it."  I sighed.  

"Maybe that's why no one uses their ability like you?"  Walker asked.  It was a rhetorical question, but I shrugged anyway.  I doubted anyone even thought that it affected you in that way.

We hadn't even made it to Dae'lin's office before the short raven haired woman stormed around the corner and stomped to a stop in front of us.  "I thought the object was to capture him alive?"

Walker laughed. "Because he attacked me.  I would have been a barbecued Venatori if it were not for Nox's quick thinking."

Dae'lin sighed.  "Your next plan?  The only other contact was connected to a Voice over IP account that bounced all over the world.  We can't track it.  It'll take days."

I smiled. "I'll send it to Ant. Jack can look at it.  He's a far better hacker than anyone in our employ."

"Because he's a path."  Dae'lin frowned. "Why do you keep using favor's Nox?"

"I don't do favor's Dae'lin.  I pay for services rendered."  

"What will you pay Wynn?"  Dae'lin asked.

"I won't pay Jack anything.  I will pay whatever Cari wishes to ask for."

"Nox, you can't afford this."

"What makes you think I can't afford whatever Il Cane will ask of me?"  I asked curiously.

"How much will it cost you?"

I shrugged.  "Maybe a pint or so of blood, maybe it'll cost me working a vamp case with Ant, or Tony.  It could cost me a favor to be extended later when she needs it.  With Cari I really have no idea what she'll ask of me to use Jack."

"Is it safe Nox?  She is not stable."

I smiled. "Dae'lin, any random person here in the Venatori is more likely to hurt me than Cari Giovanni is."

I pulled my phone out of my pocket and dialed Ant's number.  He answered on the first ring.  "What do you want?"

"Same thing I always want."

"What's that?"

"To take over the world Pinky."

Ant laughed.  "Do you ever get tired of that joke?"

I smirked, "Nope.  But I do need something."

"You always do. How can I help you, Nox?"

"I need Jack's help.  Any chance he's in town?"

"He's not in town.  He's with Cari in Italy.  And no Internet connection.  He's going insane."

"That sucks.  But give him my sympathies."

Ant added after a few moments of silence.  "He gave me a name and place I can get Truth if I need a hacker.  I'll send you the name, but he won't work with anyone he doesn't trust."

"And he trusts Jack?"  I asked.

"Jack trusts The Wicked Truth and told me how to gain his trust.  Or how to blackmail him if I had to."

"Blackmail is hardly necessary.  But I'd appreciate your help, Ant."

"I'll pick you up at 8 tonight and we'll go find Truth."  Ant said.

"I have a partner on this one.  That alright?"

Ant laughed.  "That's a new one."

"We'll see you tonight."  I hung up after Ant agreed.  

Walker sighed, "Another late night?"

"Looks that way."  I said.  "I'm gonna get my a few things done then we'll go with Ant at 8."

I headed to my room for a shower.  I could have called Sage, but I figured that would be pointless.  So I sent him a text instead.

> Me  
> 646-555-4512  
> Mon, 06/25/2015  
> ****  
> Have a late night again.  Working Late.  
> 1:05 PM  

My shower was quick and I called Treec.  She answered quickly.  I didn't even bother counting the rings I expected to go voicemail anyway.  "Hello?"

"Hey Treec.  This is Nox. I was hoping we could move our dinner to a bit earlier.  Five good?"

"Yeah sure.  I'll get off work at 4:30 so I can meet you at your place at 5."  She sounded excited.  I wasn't I was fucking nervous.  Thought I don't know why, this wasn't a date.

"Alright.  See you at five."

I had to find a baby sitter for Drake.  I'd almost forgotten about that.  Not that the Venatori care, but I did.  Drake couldn't stay home by himself there were laws against that - at least human ones.  

I walked down to the Academy to find Dorian.  I could have called but if he was busy I didn't want to interrupt him.  I found him in his office tapping away at his keyboard and staring at the monitor of his computer doing whatever it was that he did when he wasn't testing kids or creating a curriculum for them.

I knocked on the door and he called out, "Enter."  I opened the door and Dorian looked up and smiled at me.  "Nox, what can I do for you?"

I grinned at him as I sat down in the seat.  It hadn't changed any since the first time I'd sat in it.  "It's been a while since I've been in here."

Dorian nodded.  "Last time was when I told you who your father was."

I nodded with the memory.  "I know.  I was mad at you for keeping the secret from me.  For letting me hate a man who I had adored my whole life."

Dorian sighed.  "I am sorry about that.  But it was your mother's wish that you not know who your father was.  She was your guardian I couldn't disobey her even if she never took active part in your life, she was your mother, and she will always be that."

I stared blankly at Dorian.  I hated when anyone defended the woman that had given me birth.  I truly did not like the woman.  "I was hoping you could pick up Drake after school.  I have to work with Walker again tonight."

Dorian frowned.  "I'm sorry I can't.  I have a date."  The latter was said in a hushed whisper.

I had never heard Dorian say he was going on a date.  I knew he dated, but it was rare that he actually said so openly.  He was more like I was when I was younger, he choose to date outside the Venatori - it was safer and easier that way.  I wanted very much to say something but I held my tongue and nodded.  "Okay.  I'll find someone else to watch him.  You have a good time."  I stood up to leave.

Dorian chuckled.  "That's all you have to say?"

I shook my head.  "No.  Dorian it's not.  But I'm going to leave it be and be a bigger man than usual."

Dorian out right laughed.  "Your father could probably watch Drake for you.  He's been asking me how to approach you about being a grandfather to the little dragon.  He does feel guilty for not being there for you.  Why don't you let him be there for Drake."

I took a deep breath.  "Is this more than a suggestion?" I asked.

Dorian chuckled.  "Take it however you need to to ask your father for a favor."

"This is something you want me to do then?"

"Yeah.  I think you need to do it." Dorian said.

"Alright.  I will ask my father."  

I opened he door and before I stepped through Dorian added, "He's in his apartment he's probably cleaning up a little."

I turned around.  "You knew I'd ask you?"

Dorian smiled.  "Dae'lin called.  Told me the deal.  Informed me you might forget about your three year old roommate - her words, not mine.  And that I needed to make arrangements."

I sighed.  "So he was staying with Kai no matter what."

Dorian shook his head.  "No.  I knew you wouldn't forget.  But I let Kai know you would be taking my recommendation.  He was excited."

I rolled my eyes and Dorian laughed.  I pointed my finger at my mentor with a mock glare, "You played me."

Dorian nodded.  "I did.  I learned from the best."

I stuck my tongue out at him and heard Dorian laughing as I shut the door behind me to find my father.   Despite his fame and glory my father lived on the same floor as I did but in a better apartment.  His was like Dorian's and actually had a bedroom and a separate livingroom and kitchen.  It was a true apartment.  I knocked on the same door like my own and Dorian's.  

My father answered in a pair of sweats and a baseball cap.  He frowned as he saw me standing in the hall.  "Nox."

"Hi Dad.  I have a favor to ask you."

Kai moved to the side and let me inside.  His apartment was plainly painted.  There were a few pictures on the wall.  They were too far to see what they were of but I expected they were of my siblings and their families.  

Kai moved back into the kitchen and started washing dishes - again.  "What did you need Nox?  I'm kinda busy."

I grinned as I leaned across his bar to watch him.  "I have to work tonight.  I don't know when I'll be home.  I need someone to watch Drake for me.  I was hoping you might be able to.  Could do some grandfatherly bonding."

"He really talked you into asking me?"  Kai asked as he turned to look at me while he was holding a sudsy plate in his hands.

"He didn't talk me into anything.  He gave me another option and I agreed that it would be a good idea."

"Yeah, right?  Why would you let me watch this kid if you think of him like a son?"  Kai sneered but he went back to his dishes and I couldn't see his expression any longer.

"I can't let my personal feelings get in the way of family.  I hated you for so long, you have to let me sort those feelings out."

"You've had almost 4 years to do that."  Kai said plainly - the hurt in his voice was apparent.

"Maybe if you stopped treating me like some errant kid things would go better.  I am trying.  I'm here aren't I?  We sparred earlier.  I am trying Kai."  I laughed.  "Besides, I'm still dealing with my mommy issues and she left me when I was five.  I still haven't worked through that.  At least you are here trying with me."

Kai pulled the plug on his dish water and turned around.  "I guess you are right.  Margo says pretty much the same thing."

"I'll never get over the fact that you are dating my therapist." I smiled at him.  "So will you watch him for me?"

Kai laughed. "Why do you think I'm cleaning?"

"I didn't want to mention it.  Thank you."  I offered him my hand and Kai shook it firmly.  "I'll make you breakfast as payment.  I'll be by in time to feed you and Drake and get him to class on time."

Kai nodded.  "Sounds like a plan.  I have nothing here - not even coffee."

"Thanks for the heads up.  You know when to pick him up?"  I asked.

Kai smiled, "Dorian or Mia will drop him off here when he's out of class."

"Thanks again."  I said before leaving my father's apartment.  It felt weird but oddly enough it was what felt right.  I hope Drake didn't pick up on my resentment of my father.  He deserved a proper family.

After visiting my father I took a nap.  It was unlike me, but I needed sleep now or I'd not be able to function later when it mattered.  Balance needed to be restored.  The one good thing about naps is no nightmares.  It was refreshing sleeping during the day when I was supposed to.  Three hours later I woke up bright eyed and bushy-tailed as they say.  I cleaned my apartment up and started making dinner at half past four.  

At promptly 5pm there was a knock at my door.  The smell of white wine and garlic sauce permeated my apartment.  It smelled wonderful.  I took a deep breath before opening the door.  Beatrice Magellan stood in my door way wearing a long brown trenchcoat.  Her make up was perfect and her hair was pulled away from her neck in a high ponytail that fell in ringlets.  Her green eyes sparkled as I let her into my apartment.

She looked around and sniffed at the air, "Smells great."  But there was a nervous sort of tilt to her voice.

I smiled at her to take the edge off.  I wasn't wearing anything special, but she seemed like she wanted to keep the coat on.  I asked, "Can I take your coat?"

She shook her head.  "No."  Treec said as she pulled her coat tighter around her.  

I frowned.  I didn't like this, she wasn't making herself comfortable.  What could possibly be under the coat.  I went into the kitchen to start plating food.  "Would you like some wine?"  Maybe it would loosen her up a bit.  We were just going to talk, there was no need for discomfort.  It's not like I planned on seducing her.

"No."  Her voice sounded right behind me and I turned around to find the girl I'd gone to school with completely naked save for the brown trench coat that hung from her elbows.  I did my best to keep my gaze on her eyes, but I'm a weak man and my eyes scanned the woman before me.  She was curvy and plump but nothing unattractive about it.  When my eyes met hers again she lunged at me and pushed me up against the counter and started kissing me.  Her body was cool against my hands as I tried to understand what the fuck was going on.

I pushed her away from me, but she was Venatori, the most I did was give her a little more friction to rub against my leg.  I pulled back and hit my head against the cabinet.  "Treec.  Stop!"

She blinked back at me.  All the ferocity of the advance was gone in that instance as she stared back at me.  "You don't like me then."

"What does like have to do about any of this.  What are you doing?  I thought we were going to talk about what we wanted before we got to this stage."  I said flatly.

"I thought that was you just being polite.  Everyone knows you are just some whore looking for you next fuck."  Beatrice declared as a matter of fact.  "I want to have your baby what do we have to talk about?"

"A lot.  Like do you want to raise the child?  Do I?"

"Who the fuck cares?  I need to have a baby.  You need to have a baby.  What else matters."  She frowned at me. "I'm too fat, that's it isn't it?"  She sounded pissed.

"Your looks don't factor into anything.  I care who raises our child."

"You turned out just fine in the community pool.  I don't want to be a mother.  I just want this over with so I can get on with my life."

I sighed.  "So you thought you'd seduce me with a naked body and what you'd get pregnant the first time, and then you'd grow this child inside you and then what?  Throw it away.  Let it live a life without a mother or a father?"

"I'm not throwing it away.  I just can't raise a child.  And you don't seem like the fatherly type."

"Fuck you.  You know nothing about me!"

She sighed.  "That's what I was trying to do.  I'll go.  Since you aren't interested."

I let Beatrice Magellan walk out of my door before I collapsed to the floor of my kitchen with my head in my hands and my knees pulled up against my chest.  What the fuck just happened.

It wasn't the first time a girl had been aggressive.  It's how my first time happened to begin with, but this was the first time I hadn't wanted it to happen.  Hadn't been in the head space for it.  

I sat on the floor until there was a knock at my door.  I unfolded myself from the floor and then picked up my phone from the counter and glanced at the time.  It was 8 already.  I hadn't even changed.  I answered the door and let whoever it was in.  I didn't even wait to see - it was either Walker or Ant.  It didnt' matter as I headed into the back area where I could grab a clean button down shirt to pull over my t-shirt.  

Footsteps entered and shut the door behind them.  "You smell of fear, Nox.  What's wrong?"  I hated when someone knew something was wrong and particularly when they smelled the fear on me.  But when you have a vampire who can feed on emotions around it's hard not to reek of emotions.

I shrugged.  "Nothing I want to talk about, Ant."

"Your friend ditch you?"

I turned to Ant after pulling a red button down from the hanger.  "No, Walker's just not here."

"What's wrong?"  Ant asked again.

"Nothing."  I said flatly.

Ant advanced on me in a blur of vampire speed and was pushing me up against the wall with one hand in the middle of my chest.  "What's wrong?"

The words fell out in a whisper, "A girl tried to have sex with me and I pushed her away."

Ant was frowning at me.  I leaned forward so I wasn't pressed against the door anymore and he let me move.  I was thankful, I didn't want to have a panic attack.  "She wanted to make a baby.  Wanted to get her duty over with.  She assumed because I've had many partners that I would just fuck her."

"That's not what's upsetting you."  Ant said softly as he watched me take a drink of the wine in the glasses I had started pouring.

"She called me a whore."  I sighed.  "I don't know why it bothred me.  I've been called a whore before, I've been called worse things.  But she said I wasn't the fatherly type.  Like she knew I wouldn't be a good father."

Ant frowned at me.  "Dude, she doesn't know a damn thing about you."  Ant was standing next to me plucking the wine glass from my hand.  "I'm hungry."

I held my wrist for Ant.  "I fed Armand earlier.  And I killed a dragon.  Though I did nap so I should be good."

Ant sighed.  "Another time?"

I shook my head.  "No, I'd rather not owe your mother another favor."

Ant kissed my wrist softly before he let his fangs sink in.  There was a big difference between Ant and Armand's bite.  Where Armand had been friendly and pleasant, Ant's was down right erotic.  He had no control over the bite.  I felt my knees give way but Ant leaned into me pinning me against the counter as he fed from my wrist.  He took more than Armand, I felt faint but the feeling only made the euphoric state better.

"Damn." I whispered.

Ant laughed as he released my wrist, but he still held me in place.  "You good?"

I gripped the edge of the counter and nodded and felt his body move away from me, I was decidedly colder now.  There was a knock at the door and Ant moved to open it.  Walker in his faded blue jeans and his tight gray t-shirt stood on the other side.  He smiled, "Am I interrupting something?"

Ant shook his head, "We just finished."  The look he gave Walker made the other man pale.  Ant grinned purposefully showing his fangs.  A gesture he never did.

Walker's expression went blank and he stepped inside before closing the door behind him.  "You know he fed a vamp earlier today, isn't that dangerous?"

Ant shrugged.  "I offered to let him wait, he said he was good."

Walker gestured to me standing by the counter, still leaning more so than standing.  "Does that look good to you?"

Ant frowned, "He's better than he was when I got here."

Walker rolled his eyes and turned to me, "Did lover boy dump you or something?"

I shook my head.  I definitely didn't want to talk about Treec with Walker.  "Sage is working to my knowledge."

Ant smirked, "So there is a lover boy?  You are dating?"

I grinned at Ant with a playful smirk, "Jealous?"

Ant rolled his eyes.  "Of you.  Never.  Seriously, Nox.  You have a boyfriend?"

I nodded.  "I think so."

Walker laughed.  "He does.  He's ditched me twice to see him."

I picked up my wallet, my keys and my phone and opened my front door.  "Let's go talk to this Truth, see if we can find this last conspirator."



# The Den

We followed Ant outside and into the back of the building.  My stomach churned at the knowledge of how Ant intended us to get to where we were going.  He offered me his hand which I took without question.  He grabbed Walker by the elbow and he literally stepped into the shadows of the buildings and we stepped out some place else.

I bent over clutching at my stomach thankful I had eaten nothing, but the wine returned from whence it came and wasn't as good coming back up as it had when it had gone down.  I wiped my mouth, and I saw Walker was a pale shade of green retching his own stomach contents onto the alleyway pavement.

"I hate when you do that."  I said to Ant.

"Sorry.  It's faster."

I sighed, "We could have taken the train."

Ant nodded, "We could have and we could miss Truth."  We followed Ant to a black door several feet from where we entered the alleyway shadows.  Ant pushed the door in and it gave way to a long hallway with filtered music coming from the other end of it.  The doors on the side as we moved down the hallway were all locked.  I hadn't tried them all but I knew they would be.  

The room beyond the hall was filled with computer screens and black light posters everywhere.  The music was a softer version of what would be in a club, same music just not as loud.  I could hear myself think.  There was a counter with coffee and pastries and it looked like a help yourself type place, but there was a girl sitting on the other side.  Ant approached her with a bright smile made purple with the black light.

"We are looking for Truth.  You know where we can find him?"  

The girl nodded.  "I'll get him."  But she didn't move, she tapped away at her laptop and then looked up.  "He'll be along when he's free a moment.  You aren't cops are you?"

Ant shook his head.  "No, Chevalier said I could borrow his help while he's out of town."

Her eyes went wide, "You know Chevalier, like personally?"

Ant nodded.  "He's family."

"Why are you looking for Truth if Chevalier is family?"  She asked.

"He's not here and I need help now.  He's off the grid."  Ant added to clarify why we couldn't use Jack.  I thought it was funny Jack used the term for human servant for a vampire as his code name.  Ironic really.

Walker walked around the room we were in taking in the posters and glancing at screens.  No one was hiding anything as he passed.  I wondered how much he understood about what was on their screens.  It looked like gibberish to me.

I leaned against the counter of goodies and watched the room.  Ant drifted into the crowded room to the stuffed couch in the back corner.  The girl behind the counter was tapping away at the keyboard when I caught someone to my left.  "Someone wanted me?"  

My head snapped to the left, and I saw a beautiful face staring back at me.  I grinned at him.  The girl nodded in my direction.  "Him and his friends."  She tapped me on the shoulder, "This is Truth."

I offered him my hand, and he blinked at me.  "What are you doing here?" he asked.

I smiled.  "Looking for you apparently."

Sage took my hand and smiled.  "Where did you hear the name Truth from?"

I pointed to Ant sitting on the couch.  "He knows Chevalier.  I know him too, but Ant says Chevalier told him how to get you to cooperate - either through common ground or through blackmail.  I told him I didn't think blackmail would be necessary, and that was before I found out you were The Wicked Truth."

"Where did you hear thatÂ name from?" Â Sage asked.

"Same place.  Chevalier is a friend.  He's in Italy with Il Cane - no internet so he can't help me.  And I need some help with my case."

Sage grinned at me, "So this is what you will be doing late into the night? Bugging hackers?"

I laughed.  "Yeah.  I have a VOIP call that's being bounced around.  I need an origin location.  Presumably it's here in New York, but if they are a hacker, I suppose they can be anywhere to do whatever it The Dragon wants."

Sage asked nodding towards Ant, "Is he your partner?"

I shook my head.  "That is Anthony Giovanni, Il Cane's son." I looked around and found Walker staring at the computer screen of some girl who was laughing.  Walker didn't seem to understand as he watched, but she kept laughing to herself.  I pointed to the blond who was my partner.  "That's Walker.  He's my partner."

I turned to face Sage completely and smiled at him.  "You think you could help me?  Or do I need Ant's information?"

Sage grinned.  "Why should I help you?"

I smiled back at him.  "I'll cook you dinner?  Whatever you want.  No expense too big."

"If I want lobster?"  Sage asked with a soft smile on his face.

"I might need to borrow your kitchen for that.  Mine doesn't have a stove top that will handle it well."

Sage laughed, "How do you know mine does?"

"I assume you have a full size kitchen not a studio apartment."  I smiled at him.  "Am I wrong?"

Sage shook his head.  "You aren't wrong.  When can I expect payment?"

"Whenever you want."

Sage offered me his hand.  "I help you, and you cook me lobster.  We have a deal."

I gave him my hand, and we shook with wide smiles.  Sage at the end drew my fingers to his lips and kissed the back of my hand.  A shiver ran up my spine and I felt my smile grow wider.  "We have a deal."

Sage smiled.  "Let me get my things.  I need to get back home.  When do you want me to start?"

"Tomorrow is fine.  It's late now.  I'm sure Walker would be happy to take an early night."

Sage grinned.  "I'll meet you outside?"

I nodded.  "All right."

I watched Sage as he left to go back where he'd come from. I nodded to Ant, and he grabbed Walker and headed for the door.  Ant was laughing at me.  "Did you charm him into helping you?"

I shook my head.  "Not really."

Walker laughed.  "That's what it looked like."

I was grinning madly waiting for Sage to join us.  When he stepped out, I offered him my hand, and he took it with a smile on his face.  "Sage.  I'd like you to officially meet Ant and Walker.  Guys this is Sage or as you can guess he goes by Truth on the web."

Ant laughed.  "Fucking small world.  Wait if you knew a hacker already why the fuck did you come to Jack?"

I rolled my eyes.  "I've known Sage for all of four days.  I wasn't going to ask him for help like this after four days.  I wouldn't have now if it weren't for the fact that Jack trusts him.  If Jack trusts him to do jobs for Cari then I'll take him over anyone else in that joint."

Sage wrapped his arm around my waist and tugged me close.  "I would have helped either way, Nox.  Just ask me next time.  There is no need for blackmail."

"Hey, I never blackmailed you.  I bribed you.  Get that straight."  I grinned at him.

Ant asked, "What did he bribe you with?"

Sage grinned.  "He's cooking me dinner."

Ant laughed, "You know you could have done so much better than that right?"

Sage laughed.  "Let me correct myself, he's making lobster."

Ant whistled.

Walker sighed.  "I'm so jealous."  He punched me in the arm, "Do you even know how to cook lobster?"

I shook my head.  "Nope, but I intend to learn."

Sage tugged me in one direction.  "Walk me home.  I assume I'll see you two tomorrow morning, too?"

Walker looked at me.  "He'll look into the number we can't track tomorrow morning.  Say 8?"  I looked at Sage.

"Sounds good."  Sage smiled at Ant.  "Tell Chevalier that his friends are my friends if they are as cute as Nox."

Ant laughed, "Jack will agree with you on that."

I rolled my eyes.  "Jack doesn't think I'm cute.  He thinks I'm mean."

"He does think you are mean.  Meaner than Ryan, Tony or I, but he still thinks you are cute for a guy."  Ant smiled.

"He's never told me that."  

Sage tugged on me again.  "Walk me home."

I smiled at him and kissed his check, "Right.  I gotta go.  I'll see ya in the morning.  7 am I'll make you breakfast."

Ant frowned, "I don't ... fine.  I'll be there."

Walker waved.  "Have fun you two."

I smiled at him.  "Always."  Walker headed the opposite direction of us and Ant followed catching up to him and leaning in closer and Walker shook his head.  I can only imagine Ant was offering him a ride home.  Sage tugged on me again, this time I dutifully followed.  "I'm coming."

Sage grinned at me before leaning in to whisper, "Not yet you aren't."

A small moan escaped my lips before I could stop it and Sage was chuckling to himself.  "I love that."

I smiled.  "Me to,."  

We walked for several blocks before Sage turned down a side street and then down an alley way.  I asked, "Alley's are a little dicey at this time of night, aren't they?"

He smiled.  "I've pack protection.  Besides you are with me now."

"So you don't take this alley way without me?"  I asked playfully.  I knew the answer before he even said it.

"I do.  But no one will hurt me.  This is all Adrian's territory.  Even the gangs won't mess with Adrian."

"Still risky."  I said.

"Are you going to tell me not to walk down here at night?"  Sage asked.  I wasn't sure what he wanted as an answer.  It seemed a serious question, but the smile quirked on his lips made it seem a joke.

I shook my head.  "I would never presume to tell you how to live your life.  Unless you wanted me to.  You have protected yourself without me for your entire life.  Who'm I to say what's safe and what's not?"

Sage smiled.  "Most guys would have been all, 'no, you can't walk this street alone'."

"I'm not most guys."  I smiled at him.

Sage laughed, "No, you are not."  He smiled at me, "Would you prefer if I stuck to well lit pathways?"

I nodded.  "I would.  But I would stick to well lit pathways in any territory if it were me.  I'm paranoid that way."

"So you are more afraid this way than if we'd taken the long way?"  Sage asked.

"Not afraid, but there are shadows that big bads could jump out from and we'd never see them coming.  I hunt monsters for a living.  The dark is never safe for me.  Some vamps can walk from shadow to shadow with ease.  Ant is one of them.  His mother and father are two of the most powerful Shadow vamps in the world."

Sage nodded.  "I will stay on the streets then.  For you."

I smiled.  "You don't have to do it for me.  Just don't tell me you walked down an unlit alley way."  

Sage grinned.  "I'll stay to lit paths.  I don't want to cause you undue stress."

"Thank you."  I beamed at him.

"Anytime."  We turned back on to the street proper and Sage started up the stairs of one of the brownstone houses.  "This is me."  He pulled his keys out and turned to face me as he leaned against the door.  He pointed around the corner.  "Back there is my office.  You can all go there at 8 instead of trying to get me here."

I nodded with a smile.  "Okay."  

Sage and I stared at each other for several minutes without speaking.  Neither of us really wanted to part ways, but I didn't think going inside was going to be a good idea either.  Sage broke the silence first.  "Do you want to come in?"

"I do." I smiled, "But, I think it would be a bad idea."

Sage laughed.  "I promise I won't let you see my bedroom."

"Or the couch?"  I asked.

Sage nodded.  "Nothing we can use to have sex on.  Will that work for you?"

I let out a mock sigh of defeat and smiled.  "Fine, if I must."

Sage grinned and turned to unlock the door.  I followed him into the darkened entry way.  Sage walked a few feet and turned on the lamp on the table.  "Upstairs are the bedrooms.  Down here, the living room and the kitchen." Sage pointed to the living room as we walked past and let me through to the back of the hall into his kitchen.  He flipped on the light and I was greeted with a stone fireplace and a great gas stove on the other side of a large slab granite island. "Wow."  I said as I looked around at his kitchen.

Sage laughed.  "It's a shame I can't cook."

I smiled at him.  "Oh, but I can."  I ran my hands over the granite counter top.  All the appliances were stainless steel and a set of red pots hung from the ceiling, they looked like they'd neverÂ been used.

I could feel Sage watching me as I took it all in.  He asked.  "You like?"

"I love.  Why do you have such a great kitchen if you can't cook?"

"Rosie thought if I would ever attract a wife, I needed a good kitchen."

I laughed.  "A wife, huh?"

Sage laughed.  "I don't think she counted on me finding a gorgeous guy who was a great cook."  He smiled, "How did things go with that girl tonight?"

I frowned and turned my back to Sage as I pretended to still be in awe of his kitchen.  I don't think he fell for it as he put his hand on my shoulder and turned me to face him.  He asked, "What happened?"

I sighed.  "She just wanted sex.  Called me a whore when I said no and accused me not liking her because she was fat - her word not mine.  And told me I wasn't the fatherly type."  I shrugged.  "It's not a big deal."

Sage frowned and pulled me close.  "It is a big deal.  You are upset by it."  He pushed me into the bar stool next to the island.  "Sit.  Ice-cream helps heal all wounds. I might even have chocolate in here."

"No, Sage.  It's all right.  I don't need ice-cream."

Sage laughed.  "I do though."  

I watched Sage open his bottom drawer freezer and pull out a half gallon of chocolate ice-cream and grabbed two spoons from the drawer and set it down on the island and took a seat next to me.  "She's not seen you with Drake.  I have.  You are a good father."

I smiled and dipped my spoon into the ice-cream and offered it to Sage.  He grinned at me and took the proffered ice-cream.  "Don't let her get you down.  I'm sure there are girls out there that will be what you need."

I sighed.  "She is what I need.  She doesn't want to be a mother.  She only wants to have a baby - no relationship, just sex to make a baby.  But she didn't want to talk about it.  Like having sex right then was the only option - the only way I'd say okay - let's do this."

Sage nodded and took another spoonful of ice-cream.  He finished the cold mouthful before he said something.  "Clearly she has self image issues.  Large women usually do.  Was she unattractive?"  

I shook my head.  "No.  She had rolls and stretch marks, but nothing that would make me say 'Ew, get away from me.'"

"You saw her naked?"  Sage asked.

I laughed.  "She came to my apartment wearing nothing but an over-sized trench coat and when she propositioned me she did so with it hanging off her elbows gaping open to reveal her figure."

"Has anyone ever done that to you before?"  Sage asked.

I shook my head.  "I don't tell girls where I live."

"Surely Venatori girls know where you live?"  Sage asked.

I shrugged.  "They could find out I guess.  But Venatori girls don't proposition me regularly.  Remember they think I'm gay."  I waved my hand at him and ran my long fingers through the top of my hair highlighting the aspects obvious to people.

Sage reached into my back pocket and pulled out my phone and swiped and tapping away at it.  A few moments later he laid the phone down on the counter in front of us.  "This her?"

Sage had easily found Treec's contact information on my phone. I nodded, and when I did he tapped the call button.  "What are you doing?" I said reaching for the phone.

Sage had it in his hand and was pulling it away.  He tapped the speaker phone button and waited for the woman to answer.  "What the fuck do you want, Nox?"

"Nox is here, but that's not who is calling you."  Sage said politely into the air.

"Who are you?"  Treec asked.  I could hear the distinct sound of someone who had been crying. I sighed to myself and dropped my head on to my hands and took a deep breath.

"It doesn't matter who I am.  Only that I care about Nox.  He wanted to talk to you tonight about your duty to the community.  He still wants to talk to you.  And by talk I mean with words and stuff not some strange code for sex.  From what I understand, your goals and his align well, but if you'd talked about it you'd understand he doesn't want to ram it home until it takes."

I snorted at Sage's use of words.  Treec yelled, "He's right there isn't he?  Fucking bastard can't talk himself."

I sat up ready to yell but Sage put a finger to my lips and smiled.  "He is right here.  But he won't speak to you until you stop with the name calling, and you treat him with respect.  You want something.  He wants something, there is no reason why the two of you can't talk respectfully to one another and work out a solution."

"He can't fight his own fights?  He's even weaker than I thought."  Treec laughed.

I sighed.  "I reiterate my words.  Fuck you, Treec."  I used air to hit the end call button and Sage frowned at me.

Sage took a deep breath.  "I'm sorry."

I shrugged.  "None of that was your fault."

"I figured she'd listen."  Sage frowned.  "Apparently she's just a bitch in general."

I shrugged. "I'll find someone else.  Though I'm sure I'll have new rumors circulating come morning.  I came on to her, she refused me and I pushed harder.  Then I called up my boyfriend to fight my fights."

"I'm sorry Nox."  Sage stood up and wrapped his arms around me.

I smiled.  "You were only trying to help."  I turned in his arms and kissed his neck.  "I should get going Sage.  I have work to do in the morning and I need to pick up Drake at my Dad's and make them breakfast."

Sage laughed, "Do you feed everyone who does you favors?"

I nodded.  "It's my go to payment."

Sage smiled and kissed me softly.  "A kiss will do sometimes."

"Only for you, love."  I smiled up at him.

"That's twice."  Sage said as he backed up and put the ice-cream away and the spoons in the sink.

"What's twice?" I asked.

"You called me love."  Sage said from the sink as he looked at me gaging my reaction to his observation.

I took a deep breath. "Is that a problem?"

Sage shook his head.  "No.  But this isn't slowing down any is it?"

"I don't think I know how to slow down."  I grinned at him.  "I have always attached quickly to people I let in."

Sage smiled, he took my hand, and we walked back down the long hall to the front door.  "I will see you tomorrow.  Bring me coffee."

I nodded.  "Yes, sir."

Sage had his hand on the door knob but he pulled me close and wrapped his free hand around my waist and kissed me deeply.  Our tongues danced in each other's mouths and I could taste the chocolate ice-cream lingering on his tongue.  I almost wished it was still chilled from it.  The thought alone tensed my body and I let out a small sound that made Sage laugh through the kiss.  "God, I love the effect I have on you."

"Me too."  I smiled and kissed him softly on the lips.  "I'll see you bright and early."  Sage turned the knob and opened the door stepping away from me.  I waved quickly as I walked out.  I turned around when I was down the stairs, "Night, Sage."

"Night, Nox.  Text me when you get home so I know you made it safe."

I laughed.  "Okay."  I only hoped I didn't forget to when I made it home.



# Bigger Than We Thought

I was going to walk home, but I figured I'd forget to call Sage when I did.  I could pick up Drake and we could spend the night tossing and turning, but then I'd deprive my father of his grandson.  I still took the train home, and I was walking up the stairs as I sent Sage a text.

I curled up in my bed with my pillow.  There were four extra pillows now, I'd had some delivered from a store down stairs.  My phone sat on top and I closed my eyes to sleep.  If I got a response from Sage I'd wake up, if not I'd dream of him, anyway.  The sound of a loud smacking kiss woke me from the drifting I had been doing.  I glanced at my phone to see what Sage had sent.

I turned the screen off and closed my eyes.  I was still tired from my earlier extension of my energy when killing Emerson.  It was a fact I hadn't told Sage yet.  I felt the darkness take me but then I heard a soft knock at my door.  I blinked as I turned the screen on my phone and looked at the time.  

I crawled out of bed and padded over to the door in the dark, opened the door and found my mysterious blue eyed boy standing there with a grin.  I smiled and stepped aside taking his hand as he stepped inside.  I didn't say anything as I locked the door and pulled him towards my bed.  I crawled into bed and Sage stood next to the side and pulled off his t-shirt and kicked off his shoes before he sat down to tug off his jeans.  I watched the way his body moved in the dim light coming from the night light in the bathroom.

He sat there on the edge of my bed for several moments.  I don't know what he was thinking.  His back drew my attention as I watched him breathe slowly in and out.  The muscles in his back were strong and I wanted to touch him.  I reached out several times but never laid my hands on his beautiful skin.  Sage laid down on to his back with a deep sigh.  I covered him with the remaining blankets and he looked over at me with bright blue eyes that I couldn't see in the dim light, but I knew what color they were.  I dreamt about them every night.  I loved his eyes.

I smiled at him and offered him my hand; he entwined our fingers together  and laid them down between us.  I moved closer.  Sage let out a soft sigh before he moved down and closer to me, his shoulder resting under my chin and his head laying against mine.  I took a deep breath and savored the scent of him in my bed.  Butterflies swirled in my stomach as I closed my eyes.  I tightened my fingers around Sage's and he hummed softly in my ear.  "Night, Nox."  He whispered.  I kissed his shoulder and whispered in return, "Night, Sage."

Sleep came.  So did the dreams.  The dreams always came, but they were different.  Less vivid.  The red glowing eyes weren't quite so red.  More a soft glow just barely making out a color.  The pain imagined from the blows was still unimaginable.  But when the face came into view and it was time to wake up, I didn't stare into the eyes of my demon and start awake panting for breath.  I opened my eyes slowly and saw Sage watching me.  His eyes were wide open but there was concern written all over his face.  He spoke softly, "You okay?"

I smiled at him and nodded.  I didn't want to break the spell I was under.  I felt at peace seeing him in my bed.  It was hard to breathe but not from the dream.  I leaned forward closing the small gap between us and kissed Sage softly.  "I had a nightmare, but it wasn't as bad as usual.  I'm all right."

Sage sat up in bed and looked down at me.  "That wasn't a bad nightmare?  I'd hate to see a bad one."

I looked up at him confused. Â He smiled down at me and kissed my lips before he continued.  "You were holding on so tight I was afraid my fingers might fall off."  He was making light of the situation.

"I'm sorry."  I sat up and joined Sage.  I found my phone nestled between the pillows where I'd lain it earlier.  I glanced at the time and was surprised it was 5.  I looked at Sage, "Did I sleep through the alarm?"

Sage grinned.  "Yes and no.  I kinda turned it off when I found it last night.  You would haveÂ slept with it last night?"

"I was in bed texting you last night.  I'd fallen asleep after inviting you over."

Sage grinned.  "I'm glad you did.  You could have stayed at my place."

I nodded.  "Yeah, but I promised my father and Drake I'd make them breakfast this morning so Drake wouldn't be late for school. I guess that means you can meet my father."

"That doesn't sound like something you want me to do."  Sage said

"My father doesn't like that I like men.  He doesn't like that when me and my brother didn't know we were half-brothers we kissed.  We wouldÂ have done more than kiss if we hadn't gotten caught in the hall."

Sage grinned, "You kissed your brother?"  The scrunched up look on his face made me laugh.  He was making fun of me.  

"I didn't know he was my brother.  Since we found out who my father was we've gone out a couple times to pick up guys.  He and I are the only two in my family that are even remotely close.  Even the only biological full brother and sister aren't close.  But then when you aren't raised together and spend 80% of your time living in the dorms you don't become a family.  And they all lived with their mothers despite being Kai's legacy, except Iris.  She's a Monroe through and through."

"How many half siblings do you have?"  Sage asked as he took me in his arms and cuddled while leaning against the wall behind the bed.

"I have five.  Adam and Iris are both a product of the progeny program.  They are official heirs to their respective families.  Tobias, Marius and Nicholas are from three other women.  Nick is a Hampton.  My father sired an heir for Nick's mom when she asked.  Tobias, Marius and I were accidental pregnancies.  None of them had been planned.  My father didn't find out about me until I was 18 years old."

"Why did it take so long?" Sage asked as he rubbed small circles against my back.  

I was lost in the sensation of his touch. I almost didn't answer him.  But I did with a shrug.  "My mother told Dorian when she left me with him that she didn't want me to know.  And since she was legally my guardian, he had to listen to her.  The first vacation we had was a small summer break, when Dorian contacted her she told him, she had no son, and that I was Dorian's problem now.  Dorian let me stay on his couch for the two weeks we were out of school and supposed to be spending time with our families.  I spent time with his family.  His mom would take me to work with her.  Or Dorian would take me with him.  Most of the time I after that first year I'd go home with Jace."

Sage kissed my forehead.  "I can't wait to meet him."

"I'm sure Jace and Mia can't wait to meet you."  I pulled out of his embrace and crawled out of bed.  "Coffee?"

Sage nodded as he snuggled down into my bed and wrapped himself around my pillow.  I smiled at him as he shyly looked at me over the pillow.  "You are too cute."

Sage grinned.  "Too cute?  No such thing."

I laughed, but I walked away into my kitchen and I felt Sage's eyes following me as I turned on the dimmer lights in the kitchen and fixed coffee.  It was still a little before we had to be down the hall for breakfast.

I leaned on the bar that overlooked my living space and watched my boyfriend watching me.  He hid his face behind the pillow with one eye peaking out.  I grinned at him and he threw the pillow across the room and it landed on the couch and no where near me.

I continued to watch him lying in my bed.  Sage was trying to look comfortable, but he was failing miserably.  He got up from the bed and padded his near naked body towards me in the kitchen.  I watched the muscles move in his legs, the way he stepped gingerly over the cool carpeted floor.  I was grinning madly by the time he stopped in front of me pinning me against the corner of the bar and counter set up.  The full length of his body was pressed against mine.  I could feel his breath on my cheek.  He whispered, "When's coffee going to be ready?" 

I glanced at the coffee pot out of the corner of my eye.  I smiled.  "There is a cup in the pot now if you can't wait."

He grinned at me from mere inches away.  "I can wait till you can have one, too."

Sage didn't move.  He continued to press my back into the inner corner of the counter and bar.  We stared into each other's eyes sharing the air between us.  I could feel the warmth of Sage's skin through my t-shirt and boxers.  The attraction was intense as we stood there as close as possible but not doing anything other than being close.  I wanted so much more than what we were doing but I could feel the fear of rejection and commitment pressing against my brain trying to make me panic.

I buried my face in the crook of Sage's neck and he pulled me against him even tighter than we had been.  His arms were tight around my waist, one hand was running small circles against the small of my back.  I mumbled into his skin, "I think coffee's ready."

Sage turned to look at me, pulling me away from him slightly, "This is good."  He gave me a peck on my lips and pulled the two coffee cups towards him and grabbed the now full coffee pot.  "Don't be afraid of this, okay?"

I nodded.  "That's easier said than done."  I smiled and sipped at the coffee Sage handed me.

Sage grinned.  "As long as you hide in me, don't be afraid of me."

I nodded and watched over the edge of my cup as Sage drank his.  We were still close but our bodies were no longer touching, I felt cold without him pressed against me.  I felt more alone without him.  I don't know why, but I could feel the anchors of my soul being tied around this man.  I would drown in him.  I hope I didn't make him cut the tether that was binding me too him so tightly.

Sage set his cup down on the counter next to me, "A penny for your thoughts?"

I smiled.  "Same thing I think about when you are here with me."

"And that is?" Sage asked me with a bright smile placing his hands on either side of me but keeping his body from mine.

"That I'm drowning in you." I set my cup down on the other side. "But that's too deep of a conversation for five days into our relationship."  I smiled at him.

Sage leaned against me and kissed my neck.  "I like deep conversations."  The way he said it sent shivers down my spine and I had to swallow hard as he nipped at the skin on my neck.  He chuckled against my skin, his breath tickling my neck.  "I love that reaction." 

Sage leaned back and smiled at me.  "I should grab a shower.  You mind?"

I shook my head.  "Not at all."

I watched Sage collect his clothes from the floor and then walked into the bathroom to get him clean towels.  I set them down next to the sink and smiled at him as he stood in the door watching me.  "You could join me."

I let out a short moan, "Oh how I would love to, but that would lead to places we aren't prepared for."

Sage was grinning at me as he pulled two foil packs from his pants pocket.  "I came prepared."  He stepped inside and closed the bathroom door behind him and turned the lock.  Not that anyone would walk in - there was no one else in my apartment.  Sage set his clothes on the sink counter and hooked his thumbs in my boxers and pulled me close.  "Join me."

I swallowed hard and bit my bottom lip with a simple nod of my head I agreed.  I didn't trust my voice not to crack under the desire that was coursing through me.

We kissed and undressed each other outside the shower.  For the first time since we'd met our hands were unbidden.  I touched his warm skin with my hands.  His fingers kneading into my back.  I hid in the crook of his neck while he pulled my shirt over my head.  It wasn't the first time he'd seen my back.  But it was the first time I'd let anyone remove my shirt for me.  It was not something I did.  Sage held me close as I got over my panic attack.  He kissed and nipped at the skin on my neck while his fingers traced the mass of scars along my back.  I had to focus on something other than his touch on my untouched back less I release way sooner than intended. 

I pressed my body against him and he backed up against the cold glass shower wall and I reached inside to let the water warm while we continued outside.  I hooked my thumbs under his waist band and was dropping to my knees when a shrill ring pierced the heat of the moment.  Sage sighed, and I pressed my forehead to his thigh as he breathed out slowly then spoke, "That's Danny.  I should get it."

I sighed and sat back on my heels letting Sage move around me to answer his phone.  I didn't pay attention to anything beyond my breathing.  It was time to come down from the high, to breathe on my own again.  I felt empty without his body next to mine.  I wanted him in so many ways and sex was so far down the list I was lost in the feeling of it all.

I stood up and went for the door.  Sage followed me with is eyes.  "One second."  He said into the phone then pressed it to his naked chest.  "I'm sorry.  We can finish."

I shook my head.  "It's all right.  We both got work to do.  I'm gonna make you breakfast."  I unlocked the door and opened it quickly and slipped out shutting it behind me.  I tugged on my jeans from yesterday and a clean t-shirt.  I would shower later.  

I made pancakes.  I had intended to make them for Drake in the morning.  I had more than enough to make a few for Sage before he had to get to work.

I got lost in the food preparation and my own thoughts.  Thoughts of Sage and life and the fate of humanity if we didn't stop The Dragon.  Everything was a jumble when Sage stepped out of the bathroom patting his hair dry with a towel.  He was fully clothed much to my disappointment.  But he was gorgeous none-the-less, and I watched him as he slide into one of the bar stools with a bright smile.  "I'm sorry about that."

I pushed a plate with fresh pancakes and some macerated berries on top to Sage with a glass of orange juice and coffee.  "It happens.  Just the universe telling us we were moving too fast."

Sage took a sip of his new coffee and smiled.  "You believe, that don't you?"

I nodded.  "It confirmed my own hangups.  I want so much more than sex, Sage.  I'm afraid if we go that far too soon, it'll be the only thing between us."

"I get it." Sage said with a smile.  "One night stands have been the only thing you've ever done.  I will try to take it slower.  It's not everyday that you meet this great guy who is not only hot, but who is great in the sack and who wants to be more with you."

I grinned.  "Who said I was great in the sack?"

Sage laughed.  "Alice says you were passable."

"So that translate to great for you?"  I picked up an already cut piece of Sage's pancakes with my fingers and popped it in my mouth.

"Alice has a tendency to sleep with men who like other men more.  Her gaydar is way off.  Those that we've both slept with over the years I've always found to be much better than she let on.  So I am making an assumption but for a guy who travels in Adrian's circles you have more experience in such things."

I asked, "So have you slept with Alice?"  I still didn't remember his friend much.  

Sage nodded.  "A couple times.  Nothing recent."

"Does that mean you prefer men more?"  I asked curious.  I knew my answer to the question was yes.  It had always been that way.

Sage shook his head.  "I have no preference. I don't have sex with my partners right away."

I frowned at his answer.  Not so much that he didn't have a preference, but that he was pushing sex between the two of us.  "So why is it different with us?"

"I could ask the same of you?"  Sage smiled as he continued.  "It's been five days.  It's been fast in those five days.  But we've spent time apart in those days, and time together each and every day.  If this were one of my normal relationships, we'd have spoken maybe once or twice in between dates.  We've had five dates.  Normally that's just over a month of seeing each other every weekend for a few hours.  The sexual tension has been high since that first day.  That it took us five times before either of us asked the other is kinda amazing."

Sage smiled and said, "So tell me why it's different for you?"

I sighed.  "I hadn't expected to pick you up Friday night, I hadn't expected to pick anyone up.  I had every intention of dancing until Jace and Mia were ready to go home and then call it that.  I didn't plan on meeting a hot guy who played the game as well as I did.  And in the end you won because you left me wanting more.  You took my means of hooking up that night and you left me your card in its place.  I kept your number.  If it weren't for Mia, I probably wouldn't have called you.  But I'm glad she sent you that text.  It made me get off my ass.  But that's why you are different.  But I'm different too."

Sage asked, "How so?"

"I want to settle down.  I want a family.  I know I have to do my duty - to create an heir.  But it's more than that.  I want my own family.  I want someone to love me unconditionally, forever.  I've never had that before and having a kid guarantees that.  But I don't think it's enough.  I want someone to love me."  I turned around and packed things up to go to my father's place.  I hated bearing my soul to strangers.  Sage wasn't a stranger, but he wasn't Margo or Dorian and I didn't knowÂ how he'd react to any of that.

A hand found my belt loop, and a finger hooked it turning me to face those beautiful blue eyes.  "That's why you think this is moving too fast isn't it?  Because that's what you want in this relationship?  You want a life with me?"

I looked down.  My voice was low as I spoke. "I can't see life without you.  And it scares me to think I've grown this attached to you this fast.  And that in the end it's too fast for you.  I don't want to face the piper someday.  I'd rather do it now when it'll hurt less.  Because it's going to hurt no matter what."

Sage pulled me closer and tightened his grip on me.  "I'm not going anywhere.  Too fast or not.  Like I said earlier, this is not scaring me away.  I have my own fears."

I whispered in his ear as he held me tight and I wrapped my arms around him tighter, "Like what?"

Sage laughed in my ear.  "My fear is I can't keep your attention.  I don't have the experience you do."

I pulled away from Sage and grabbed his chin to make him look into my eyes.  "I like that you haven't done what I have.  No, I love it.  Because if you want to explore it, I get to explore it with you.  We can learn what we like together, and what we don't.  Sex is just that, Sage, it's just sex.  I want more than that with you."

Sage smiled.  "See, we have our own hang ups about this relationship.  I will slow down.  I want to explore everything with you."

I returned the smile.  "Good."  I nipped his neck, and the kissed it softly before pushing him away with a wide smile.  "What did your Dad want?"

Sage sighed, "It was work related.  I told him about you coming by, he told me to help you.  Said it could be linked with what I was working on."

"Ah."  I grinned at him, "Did you tell him he interrupted things?"

Sage blushed, and I chuckled as I packed the rest of breakfast away.  "No." He said.  "But I need to get home to work."

I nodded.  "I figured.  I'll see you soon."

Sage grabbed me by the waist and spun me towards him and kissed me thoroughly.  We broke apart breathless.  Sage smiled.  "That's to hold us over while we work."

I chuckled.  "I don't know if that will hold us over, but it's a start.  We might have to refresh it at lunch."

Sage grinned.  "I will see you soon, Nox."  He walked around the bar to the bed and pulled on his shoes.  I watched the fine movements of his fingers tying the laces.  He moved slowly.  He knew I was watching.  Sage looked up at me as he stood up and headed for the door.  He pulled the foil packs from his pocket and grinned before sliding them back in.  "We will use these someday soon."

I bit my bottom lip in anticipation.  I looked forward to that.  Sage stopped on the other side of the bar before my front door and leaned on it.  "One more?"

I laughed, but I closed the distance to my side of the bar and leaned across.  Sage met me half way and the kiss was soft and wet.  He pulled away still leaving me breathless.  "I will see you later."  Sage left with a grin.  I would see him soon.  I had time to grab a shower and before I needed to make Drake and my father breakfast.

I missed Sage, but I had things to do.  But when I got out of the shower I sent Sage a text.

> Me  
> 646-555-4512  
> Tue, 06/26/2015  
> ****  
> The shower was lonely without you.  
> 5:37 AM  

I was outside Kai's apartment door when I received Sage's reply.

> Mysterious blue eyed boy  
> 646-555-2915  
> Tue, 06/26/2015  
> ****  
> You are making me regret leaving early.  
> 5:47 AM  

I laughed as I knocked on Kai's door.  I heard little footsteps inside the apartment.  The door unlocked and opened.  My father was no where to be seen.  I sighed as I lifted the little dragon up.  He chirped, "Hi, Nox.  Poppi is still in bed."

"Drake, you can't answer the door without a big person all right?"

"Poppi told me too."  Drake chittered on about what he and Poppi did.

"Then I guess I'll be having a chat with my father about proper parenting.  And I'm the kid here."  I set Drake down.  "Go get ready for school.  I'm gonna go get Poppi up and have a chat."

Drake ran off to get his things situated while I walked down the hall to my father's bedroom.  The door was wide open, and it was dark inside. There were no windows to let in the little light outside.  My father didn't rate a window, it made me smile. I flipped the light on and my father groaned and covered his head.  "Kai, my child, a three-year-old cannot under any circumstances answers the door by himself.  He's three!"

Kai sat up and blinked.  "I knew it was you."

"And if it wasn't?"  I asked.  "I know it's been a while since you have had little kids, but they don't answer doors unless you are watching them."

Kai rolled out of bed.  "It won't happen again."

"Okay."  I said, and I left the room.

"You took that well?"  Kai laughed.  "I expected you to yell more."

"I'm learning as we go too, why would I be a dick about it?"  I asked.

Kai nodded.  "Because I wasn't there for you."

I smiled.  "I'm trying to be a better son.  I'm going to make breakfast."

Kai chuckled.  "You had me babysitting to get laid?"   Kai grabbed my chin and pressed his thumb against my neck just above my t-shirt collar.

I shook my head and laughed.  "No.  Walker and I went looking for a hacker.  Just turns out the hacker we were looking for was my boyfriend.  What can I say?"

My father went to his bathroom to shower, and I made breakfast.  It would be an interesting morning.  Drake climbed up on to the bar stool in Kai's kitchen.  I smiled at him as I set left over pancakes in front of him. "They aren't hot, but they are fresh."

He grinned and picked it up to eat with his fingers.  I asked him, "Are your things ready to go?"

Drake nodded.  "Yes, sir.  Poppi didn't let me make a mess."

"That's good."  I smiled.  "You want hot pancakes and eggs?"

Again Drake nodded.  "Yes, please."

I made sausage for everyone I wasn't sure what my father liked but since he ate in the cafeteria most days a home cooked meal is better than one there.

Eggs would be last - I hated cold eggs.

The pancakes were only a few, I made a couple for Drake and my father besides the ones Drake was eating while the rest of the food cooked.  My father didn't have a coffee maker - blaspheme.  I would have to rectify that.  I hadn't had enough coffee yet.  I sighed.

By the time the food was cooked my father was coming out of his bedroom wearing jeans and a t-shirt.  "Damn, I don't think my kitchen has ever smelled this good."

I sighed. "It'd smell better with coffee brewing."

Kai frowned.  "Sorry.  I grab a cup downstairs."

"I figured.  I'll have to grab a few more cups before I go meet my hacker."

"You mean your boyfriend." Kai smiled.

"He's that, too."

Drake asked, "Can Sage come by again?  I liked him."

"I'm sure he'll be back again soon, Drake.  I think he liked you too."  I smiled at the little dragon as he shoveled more food into his mouth.  I wondered if he was going through a growth spurt or if all dragons at this much. I was leaning towards the latter.

We ate in almost perfect silence.  But Kai did ask a few questions which I answered.  We didn't want to talk too much about work in front of Drake and we had little in common beyond that.

Breakfast was finished, and we were heading out the door.  It wasn't the best breakfast I'd ever had, but it was the first breakfast I had with my father.  It was the first solo meal we'd ever had.  And it went rather well all considering.

I dropped Drake off at school and Ant and Walker were just walking up outside my apartment.  



# Tracking the Signal

We took the train to Sage's house.  Ant hide in the shadows but since most of it was underground it made littleÂ difference.  He didn't have to be there.  But this was his contact, so he came, anyway.  Even though I knew Sage would do this for me and all I had to do was ask.

We walked around the side of the house where Sage told me to meet him.  I knocked and the familiar voice called, "It's open," from the other side. 

I opened the door and walked into the cool air of the basement Sage worked in.  The first room was about the size of his living room with a kitchette, much like my studio apartment, but I expected that there was a bedroom down the hall. Sage could rent this place out.  But instead he used it as his work space.  

Sage looked up and smiled at me.  The others had followed me in but he only nodded at them.  "Let me finish up with this here and we can work on that number.  Though not sure why it took three of you to do this part?  It's not like you'll be much help."  He was grinning at me, the others were looking around and didn't see it.

Walker just chuckled.  "It's our case, and Ant feels obligated to be here because you are his contact."

Sage laughed.  "I guess.  But I know Nox - rather well, actually."

Ant nodded as he sat down in a chair at another computer.  "Jack insisted."

"Ah."  I said. "Don't want to upset Jack."

Ant rolled his eyes, "Don't want to upset mother. Jack doesn't want the Venatori hurting his friend."  

I laughed.  "Did you tell Jack we were dating?"

Ant nodded.  "I did.  He laughed.  Mother laughed and then said, Nox doesn't date, you know this better than anyone.  Nox may not hurt this boy.  That was her exact command."  Ant sighed.  "And since I know you better than they do, I'm only here to keep them happy.  I'm not here to babysit.  I will find a dark corner and sleep until evening.  If that's all right with you?"

"You can take a bed upstairs."  Sage said.

Ant was already gone.  He'd slipped into his day sleep well away from the windows.  "He's asleep already.  He is fine here. Â As a vampire he doesn't feel comfortable above ground during the day."

"But he was walking around outside."  Walker said.

"He's primeval, but he's not a day walker.  He can't stay in the sun long.  You notice he stuck to the shadows, and he covered from head to to sun except for his face.  Sun block helps keep his face from burning, but Ant is still not a day walker just not completely combustible under the sun."
Walker handed Sage a piece of paper.  "This is the number we need tracked."

Sage took it and looked at the number.  "What did your tech people find out?"

Walker shrugged and headed for the kitchenette.  "I'll let lover boy tell you the details."

I sat down next to Sage and shook my head.  "Nothing really.  They said it bounced all over the place and that they couldn't track it down.  They'd pin it down and then it would jump again.  So we got no where."

Sage nodded as he tapped away at his computer.  "Your tech guys are they trained?"

"Our tech guys go to college and learn about computers, but they don't practice like you do.  It's rare for Venatori to get involved in human things. Venatori aren't geeky enough to play at hacking or other such things."

Sage smiled.  "So you needed someone who cares a little more about it?"

I nodded. "Basically."

Sage worked silently.  I leaned back in the chair and watched him.  Not in a curious about his work way, but in the admiration of his body.  The way he moved and sat.  How his face contoured into a scrunched up way when he was thinking.  He smiled sideways after several minutes.  "Are you going to watch me like that all day?"

I shrugged.  "I like watching you.  But I'm sure even your gorgeous self will become boring after too long."

Sage chuckled.  "My dad was telling me he thinks what I'm doing in my day job is linked to what you are doing.  He told me to help you and to see if they were.  Why would he say that?"

"If you are working something in the human realm, chances are what I'm working on are connected.  They usually are.  Danny is an FBI Agent so there must be something going on.  If The Dragon is up to disturbing human society, it's probably been showing up in things."

"He said if this pans out I could tell you what I was working on."  Sage said as he worked.  He waved his hand for me to come look.  I got up and rested my forearms against the back of his chair.  Sage leaned his head against my chest before he sat back up and pointed out things on the screen.  "This is your signal bouncing around.  Every time I ping it it follows this same path."  All I saw was a bunch of numbers on the screen I couldn't see any path, but I saw the same pattern of numbers over and over again with each pass through.

Sage pointed at another window.  "This is what I've been working on.  This person is using the same IPs each time.  The paths are identical."  Sage looked up at me with a wide grin.  "You want to know what I've been working on?  Well me and a few other guys in the company?  We are taking shifts."

I backed up and Sage swiveled around in his chair.  I moved to get in my chair but Sage grabbed my hand and pulled me into his lap.  It was awkward with all 6 feet of my long gangly self sprawled out on top of the man below me.  His three extra inches of height only helped so much.  But it didn't stop Sage from pulling me into his arms and resting his head on my shoulder.  He spoke softly in my ear, his breath tickled my ear as he spoke.  "Someone's been trying to hack into the New York Stock Exchange.  So far we've been able to fend them off.  But even with the three of us working in shifts we can't do much more."

Even though the words coming out of Sage's mouth were nothing sexy, my body still reacted to his words.  His voice made me want to writhe against him.  His breath against my skin tightened things deep inside me and the primal urges rose.  But nothing he said should elicit that reaction, yet I was still swallowing hard and taking slow deep breaths to avoid a public reaction.

I could feel Sage grinning against my neck.  "You are so easy."

I laughed.  "You have no fucking idea."

Sage kissed my neck, "Oh, I think I have an idea."

I cleared my throat, but I didn't move.  "Back on topic, that sounds like it would disrupt human society.  Are we sure this isn't just a distraction for something bigger?  Or is this their big attack?"

Sage shrugged.  "I don't know.  But Danny said if I could link the two together in anyway I was at your complete disposal.  I'm working for you not the government, not the company.  You.  Danny says if you are hunting something it takes priority over human laws.  The Clandestine Providence comes first."

"At my disposal?" I grinned.  

Sage nipped at my neck in response.  "I'm sure he meant business."

I sat forward and looked back at Sage.  "I'm sure he meant that too, but I like the other ramifications."

Sage grinned, "Me too.  But what can I do to help you track this dragon down?"

I stood up and paced, "Can you track either of them, or both of them?"  I sighed, "If it's a digital attack it can be from anywhere in the world.  We might have to enlist more help than I like."

Walker walked in from the back and sighed, "What's wrong with him?"  He gestured to me but was talking to Sage.

Sage laughed.  "He has to ask for help, I think."

I stuck my tongue out at Sage.  He smiled at me and stood up.  I was pacing back and forth and Sage stopped in my path and grabbed me by the shoulders and whispered, "What did I tell you about that?"

"You've said a great many things.  Which one?"  I asked.

Sage grinned, "About sticking your tongue out at me?"

I had forgotten he'd said something about it.  I shook my head.  "What about it?"

Sage raised an eyebrow, "Stick it out again."  I bit my bottom lip as he made the request which sounded more like he would not accept anything less than obedience.  My body tightened and I obeyed, sticking my tongue out again slowly.  Sage leaned forward and sucked my tongue into his mouth and sucked on it before biting it between his front teeth.  I let out a small moan and Sage let go.  "I told you what I wanted to do."

"You can do that anytime."  I said breathless.  I almost stuck it out again with childlike abandon.

Walker interrupted our moment.  "Get a room."

I'd forgotten about him.  Sage turned around to him and stuck his tongue out in mockery.  He smiled and turned back to me, his hand slipping from my shoulders down my chest to my waist.  "What do you need me to do?"

I smiled. "I need you to find where they are located.  But I don't want to interrupt your work, they can't disrupt things."

Sage nodded.  "Danny said I was yours.  He's got another guy to replace me.  They will fight the attack, my job is to help you catch whoever is doing it and stop them."

"If you can find the location of this phone, it would be a great help."  I said with a smile.  

My boyfriend grinned at me as he gave me a flourished bow, "As you wish."

From the shadows in the corner Ant let out a huff of air and bit back a loud laugh that sounded more like a snort.  "You are wasting your best lines on him, Wicked Truth.  The boy doesn't watches movies unless supernatural, monster hunters, hero type movies or shows."

Sage sat down and was swiveling to look up at me, "You have never seen the Princess Bride.  Like never?  Not even to impress a girl?"

I shook my head.  "I don't impress girls by showing them movies.  You know exactly how I impress girls."

Sage blushed a little before he turned back around.  "We will have to fix this.  What was the last movie you saw?" he asked even though his fingers were clacking away on the keyboard.  

"Jace took me to see Guardians of the Galaxy."  I said sitting down in the chair I had vacated before.

"By take," Ant said, "he means, Jason dragged him out away from some case or another or from another endless night out clubbing."

Sage giggled.  "So did you at least like it."

"Oh, I loved it.  Rocket was just awesome, and one can never get enough of Vin Diesel saying 'I am Groot'.  Starlord was a pretty cool hero."  I was happy I remembered the names of the characters.  It was one of my favorite movies I had seen it before Jace dragged me to it.  And he only dragged me because I had hit a bad spot when I realized I was lonely.

Ant laughed.  "And he goes all introspective again. What ran through your head then?"

I stuck my tongue out at Ant.  He laughed again.  "Don't expect me to do what your boy just did."

"You don't like boys.  I would never expect it of you."  I declared.  

Ant sighed, "I like you.  As much as it pains me to admit.  Mother was right about that."

"Your mother said you liked me?"  I asked.

"She told me the first time you offered to feed me and I accepted that you would be more than a friend."

Sage asked, "Why would she say that?  You feed on random strangers don't you?"

"Not random.  But yes strangers.  There are feeding clubs and that's what I hit.  Cari feeds only on her herd and her lovers.  She said when I choose to feed on a person who wasn't a stranger that person would be a strong attraction.  She said because that person was against my typical attraction it would skew my attraction.  I can't say I'd enjoy the company of another man, but Nox I enjoyed the intimacy with.  But to ease your fears, Sage, Nox and I have not been together for about a year now."

Sage chuckled.  "Why not?  He not that good?"

Ant laughed hard.  He pointed at Sage looking at me.  "I like him."  He chuckled.  "That's not it.  Nox hasn't been looking for just sex for a while since he knows I'm not serious about men in general we kinda slowed down and then it stopped.  We are still friends, he will still feed me we don't have sex anymore."

Sage frowned as he looked over at Ant.  "You can still be friends after that?"

Ant nodded.  "He wasn't a serious lover, it was a fun distraction for both of us.  And it was never more than it was."

My mysterious blue eyed boy turned back to the computer screen and started working again.  "I could use some coffee."

I stood up.  "I'll get you some.  If you have any, I'll make it."  

Sage turned to me.  "I don't have any coffee."  He frowned.  "I should keep more food around with you here."

"That's all right I'll go get something, what do you want?" I asked Sage.

"Triple latte grande."  Sage grinned.

I nodded.  "Ant you want anything?"

"I'll take you."  He looked at Walker who had been watching things and saying nothing.  "What do you want?"

Walker frowned.  "Decaf."

Everyone turned to him slack jawed as he grinned at us.  "Kidding.  Black three sugars."  

Ant clapped Walker on the back of his shoulder and smiled.  "That's better."

I walked over and kissed Sage on the check.  "I love the way you smell."  

Sage grinned at me.  "I smell like you.  And I like it."  He grabbed the back of my neck and he pulled me over his shoulder and kissed me deeply.  His tongue snaked into my mouth and I let him control the kiss. I couldn't help the small sounds that escaped my mouth.  Sage hummed happily into my mouth.  He pushed me away with a smile.  "I like the way you taste too.  But I need coffee."

"What was it you said before... As you wish?"

Sage grinned up at me.  "That's it.  Thank you, love."

"You are welcome, love."  I kissed his cheek again, and I walked over to Ant. 

He laughed.  "You ready?"

I shook my head.  "No.  But we can go anyway."

Ant grabbed my elbow, and we stepped into the shadows.  There was a wrenching sensation, and we were sitting in another set of shadows.  I crouched down near the floor and held my stomach and fought back the nausea.  Ant chuckled above me.  "You always take it so poorly.  Even Allison who is weak in the stomach around everything else can travel this way without so much as a burp now."

I chocked out a laugh.  "She's been doing it for like 80 years, Ant.  I've only known you four."

Ant laughed.  "Wuss."  He grabbed my elbow and walked through the sunlit path with a grin.  He danced through the sunlight.  "It's amazing to watch a fledgling vampire stand here in the sunlight and not burn.  The investment in the technology my mother spent on the windows here always seemed like overkill to the investors until Bernstein walked in the sunlight for the first time in over 1000 years.  You should have seen the look on the old man's face."

I stood up and smiled.  "I can imagine.  Cari never invests poorly.  She's done well."  I looked up at the windows that spanned the highest heights of the Night Life building.  I had to look down quickly and Ant laughed.  "Let's get that coffee."

"Let's.  Though I have a question.  Sage?  You serious?"  Ant asked.

"It's beyond serious, Ant. I can't see life without him.  It's fucking scary." I confessed.

"It's not been a long time has it?" I shook my head and Ant continued. "Be careful you don't scare him away."

"That's my biggest fear. My nightmares have encompassed that inevitable rejection."

"You keep thinking like that and you will.  He likes you.  The desire in the room... I'm not an incubus but I could feed off of the desire between the two of you.  That kiss woke me up from the sleep only the dead feel."

"Yeah, sex is one thing but I'm a mess, Ant."

Ant clapped me on the back.  "It wasn't sex I was referring to.  I've been around my mother long enough to know when it's about sex and when it's more.  She may not see my father often, but the entire world changes when he's around."  Ant smiled.  I wondered if he wished he'd known his father more growing up.  

"You sound like you'd like the whole happy family thing?"  I asked.

"It might have been nice to grow up like China and Henry, with our father always there being a good father - a good example.  But then I wouldn't be an Enforcer, nor would I be the second most feared vampire in the world.  Ryan was a good father figure, but he's a better friend."

I grinned at my friend.  "It sounds strange to hear, but I get it.  Dorian was much the same."

Ant nodded.  "My life and my circle are still very much the same as when I grew up.  As is yours?  Mine only changes as Cari's herd does."

"Everyone except Ryan and Mia."  I nodded with understanding.  800 years of life and his circle of friends had never changed over the centuries.  "Then I'm glad you met me.  I get to broaden your horizons."

Ant laughed.  "In so many ways, Nox.  So many ways.  Let's get your boy his coffee."

The Night Life building was vampire friendly and was anything in the building had to be open 24/7 every day.  The only time I'd ever heard of the Night Life being closed was during a blizzard and everything in New York City closed down.  

It was a high rise skyscraper with doctor's offices, lawyer offices, shops and as many other businesses you could think of.  But mostly it was services.  There was even a school that had classes at midnight and beyond, it was accredited and the classes you took there could be used towards a degree at Columbia University or NYU.  Some Venatori taught classes there.  I had never taken a course there myself, but Dorian had.  He'd even given a few lectures there when I was younger.

The coffee shop catered to vampires if you knew how to ask for blood in your coffee.  I knew Ant drank regular coffee though.  Starbucks was a national franchise that catered to vampires around the world.  It was one of those places that had hidden menus and sometimes you could even order a specific blood type in your coffee.  It was an ingenious ploy, but I knew the parent company was run by vampires.  Vampires, Venatori and many other old supernatural races ran the biggest companies in the world.  Apex Unlimited was one of the big conglomerates, they had their finger in everything.  Asher Eriksen was huge into science though, like most of the Eriksen family.  

We got Sage and Walker what they wanted and two black coffees for ourselves.  With hot coffee in hand Ant took them the coffee cup tray in one hand and grabbed my elbow again and stepped into the shadows.  I nearly lost my breakfast on Sage's couch.  I hated shadow traveling and was grateful that was the last time.

Sage and Walker had both jumped at our sudden appearance.  Walker laughed through the heightened awareness of fright. "I'll never get used to that," he said.

I took my coffee and Sage's from the cup holder and set down his in front of his mouse that was not being used as he tapped away at the keyboard.  He looked up with a grin and said, "Thanks."

"Anytime."  I replied as I sat down.

Sage chuckled.  "You guys don't have to stand around waiting for me.  Go do whatever it is you do."

Walker laughed.  "I could go beat up your boyfriend again."  He grinned.  "You up for it, Nox?"

I shook my head.  "I'm quite happy where I am.  Why don't you go tell Dae'lin that the human agencies are looking into our dragon issue?  We might need a bigger cover story than our lone bank robber.  Emerson's death will be noticed as well."

Walker frowned.  "Fine.  I'll go do that.  I'll be back in an hour.  I'll leave you and your boy toys to play while I'm away."

I rolled my eyes.  "Neither of these two are my boy toys.  And I'm sure Ant will go to find something else to do to keep himself occupied."

Ant nodded.  "Yes.  Mother is calling.  Naggingly so. Watching you doesn't take priority over whatever it is she needs me for."  Ant smiled.  "I'll be back at dusk.  I'll use the door and call first."  And with that Ant was gone as he stepped into the shadows and went to wherever his mother had said to go.

"His phone never made a sound."  Walker said.

"He's a vampire, he can be called by his sire.  Cari is a technophobe, she wouldn't use her phone unless necessary."  I stated simply.

Walker shook his head.  "I don't think I'll ever know as much about this side of our world as you do."

I shrugged.  "Just don't shoot first and never ask question."  I smiled.

Walker waved.  "Sage, don't let your lover boy over there run the show.  He seems to be a know it all."

Sage laughed.  "Only to you. And only about the world he lives in.  He's pretty duh when it comes to mine.  Trust me."

Walker laughed as he left the basement apartment that was Sage's office.  Sage sank into the chair and relaxed visibly.  "You okay?"  I asked.

Sage nodded.  "Just too crowded in here.  Thanks for that."

I smiled.  "No problem.  I'm gonna go for a walk around Hell's Kitchen."

Sage frowned.  "You don't have to go."

"I know, love."  I got up and walked over to my blue eyed boy.  I kissed his cheek and smiled.  "I need to let you work and if I stay I'll be distracted by you or worse yet, distract you from the job at hand.  Besides, I can learn a lot out on the street by myself."

Sage nodded.  "All right.  I'm gonna call for reinforcements if you aren't back in an hour."

"Gotcha."  I smiled and kissed Sage's other cheek.  "I'll be back in an hour."



# Viva La Revolution

Walking around Hell's Kitchen was a bit nostalgic for me.  It was Adrian's territory and I used to walk around the neighborhood before and after sessions when I was avoiding my other lessons.  I'd grown a lot since I first roamed.

You could tell where the roan wolves holed up in Adrian's pack.  The area vibrated with power.  Human magic didn't vibe the same way.  But there were patterns to every magic.  And I let myself see everything.  Everything was made of elements - science agreed with me.  I could see each individual pattern.

A man walking past me was shrouded by his dragon form.  Humans and other Venatori couldn't see it.  But I could - it was my gift.  A gift that could make you sick if you didn't know how to control it.  It was partially the reason why I still went to therapy.  Seeing things was something I did on a regular basis and my gift was rare.  I needed verification in my thoughts and feelings upon some images.

I felt the power of a few wolves hanging out in on their front stoop.  They called out after me.  "You don't belong here Venatori."

I smiled and I let the power of Adrian's pack flow through me and I felt their power pulse and then die down in submission.  I could safely walk through Hell's Kitchen.  Adrian's power protected me.  Though Adrian said it was my power that did it.  He was only a means to a making it feel pack like.  The men outside the house whispered but I didn't bother with trying to listen.  They were not worth my time.

The air was warming up under the morning sun and I wove a cooling pattern around me as I walked.  There were pockets of dragon magic throughout the city, but here in Hell's Kitchen there was more than I was expecting.  Adrian ran a tight ship.  Did he know of the dragons?  I wished for Dorian's photographic memory but my mapping application on my phone was going to have to do that job for me.  I started mapping out the dragon pockets.  It could mean trouble, it could be nothing.  I had never tried to map the city this way before.  Maybe I should do it.

I walked and mapped until I received a phone call.  It was Sage.  I was glad I changed the ring tone.  "I'm sorry.  I know I'm late."

There was a rustle and then Sage spoke with a laugh, "It's two hours later than you said you'd be back.  But that's not why I'm calling.  I found your phone."

Two hours?  I frowned.  But Sage continued.  "I'm tracking it's location so I'll have it when you get here.  Are you alright? I'm sorry I forgot to send in the cavalry."

I laughed.  "You were busy.  I was busy.  No big deal.  But I'm glad I'm not the only absent minded one when working."  I turned towards Sage's apartment.  "I'll be there in about ten.  I'll call Walker and let Ant know Jack's debt has been paid."

"Alright.  I'll see you soon, Nox."  Sage hung up with little ceremony and I sent Walker a text.

> Me    
> 646-555-4512
> Tue, 06/26/2015  
> ****  
> Meet me at Sage's.  He found our dragon.  
> 11:21 AM  

I then dialed Ant's number.  

He answered.  "What's up?  You and lover boy done?"

I laughed.  "Actually yeah.  He found our dragon.  Thank you for your services."

"I didn't do anything except point you at your boy.  You want me to come along?"  Ant asked.

"It's best to keep the vampires out of dragon business for now.  But I suspect that this is bigger than we expected.  Emerson was in a vamp safe house.  The Dragon was using Val as a go between.  War is coming.  Let's not set Il Cane's side just yet."

Ant sighed.  "Call me if you need me Nox.  I will come at a mere thought if you open to it."

"I know, Ant.  I know. Gotta go."  I sighed as I hung up the phone.  The one downside to feeding a vampire was usually you were enthralled by them.  One downside to drinking their blood for healing benefits - you connected yourself to them.  Ant and I had done both over time and the connection was near permanent but we both kept it closed off.  Danger was one thing we both sensed from the other.  Hopefully it didn't get that far.

I was closer than I thought to Sage's apartment, I must have been walking around in concentric circles.  I knocked on the door before turning the door knob only to find Sage standing directly in front of me when the door opened.  He was grinning at me with a bright smile and those gorgeous blue eyes I loved so much.

"Hi."  I said.

Sage laughed.  "Hi.  Is Walker coming?"

I shrugged.  "I texted him.  I don't know if he was done with Dae'lin or not."

Sage took my hand and pulled me inside closing the door behind him then backed me up with his hands on my chest against the door. I hummed at him in question before he leaned down and kissed me deeply.  The kiss left my lips swollen and wet and I was breathless when he pulled away, my hands still in his as he walked backwards to his desk chair.  

He sat down with barely a glance backwards, his eyes never leaving mine.  He pulled me into his lap one leg on each side and my body pressed against his chest.  He grinned up at me and took a handful of hair and pulled me in for a kiss.  My jeans grew tighter.  I could feel Sage's arousal through our clothing and let out a soft growl.

The apartment door burst open with a red-face and I turned to see who had interrupted us.  Walker was coming in skidding to a halt when he noticed what we were doing.  He started to stutter before he turned and closed the door behind him.

I turned back to Sage who was a soft shade of red.  He chuckled up at me as I pressed a tender kiss to his forehead.  "One day we won't get interrupted."  I stood up and straightened my self out before continuing.  "I'll go get him."

Sage sighed but nodded his acceptance and turned to his computer to show us what he had found.

I opened the door and found Walker sitting on the steps leading down to the door.  He was still a little red.  I closed the door behind me, "You alright?"

Walker nodded.  "I guess I should have taken my time."

"It's alright.  If we kept at it you'd probably walked in on more than kissing."  I grinned playfully at him.

Walker covered his eyes and then his ears.  "I don't want to know."

I laughed.  Walker stood up and we went back inside.  Sage was speaking the moment he saw us both walking towards him.  "The phone's here.  It's been there for the past 5 minutes."

I took a set of comms out of my pocket. "I shouldn't do this, as you are a civilian, but I need your computer to tell me where we are.  Can you track my phone and Walkers?  And tell us when she moves?"  I handed Sage an ear bud. "We can all talk through these."  I handed Walker one as well.  I showed Sage how it sat in my ear with my own.  

Walker asked, "You just have a set of these lying around?"

I shook my head.  "Not lying around.  I had them from when I worked with my mother and Michaela.  Boulder never asked for things back."

Walker just laughed.  "That's why we are missing so much equipment."

"No they subscribe to a this is yours now policy.  Take care of it you aren't getting more."  I said.

Sage smiled.  "Yeah I can do that.  I've worked with Danny like this once.  I wasn't supposed to, I was 16 at the time."

I kissed the top of Sage's forehead and left his basement apartment office space.  Thankfully the phone was in New York City.  It was in Hell's Kitchen at the moment - stationary and hopefully doing her thing.  And by her thing I meant hacking.  I asked.  "Sage, can you get a status on your friends progress.  Is our hacker busy?"

I heard Sage's voice in my ear and smiled.  "I can do that."

Sage started typing away at his keyboard - or that's what I assumed the sound was.  Walker laughed.  "He's a typing machine."

I shrugged. "He does it for a living he should be good at it right?"

Walker nodded.  But Sage came back over the comms.  "They are still trying to fight the hacker."

"That's good.  Let us know if anything changes."  I said before moving on to our destination.

We moved through several different neighborhoods before we closed in on the signal.  This place was more run down than most of the other places we'd walked through.  Walker went around the back while I went in the front.  I let my senses drift around me.  I could feel the varying magics around me.  I could see the patterns of the world in front of me.  I could see and smell things that were not perceptible before.

The front door to the building was unlocked as I went in.  It creaked eerily as I pushed it open.  But there was no one and nothing but a long hall and stairs before me.  I whispered.  "Can you get an elevation on that phone?"

Sage spoke back clearly in my ear though it sounded little more than a whisper.  "Negative.  Software isn't that good.  I'll write a better one for next time."

"Got it."  I said.  "I'll go up, you check here and down Walker."

"Confirmed."  Walker said into his own comms.  

I went upstairs.  The floorboards squeaked with each step.  It didn't matter how quiet we were, this was a den of dragons.  I didn't dare draw my gun, but I formed a pattern in front of me that would serve as a shield or net as needed.  I just hope I didn't need the shield.  Things would end badly if it did.

Sage whispered over the comms.  "Nox, you are coming up on the signal to your right."

I moved to the door to my right and listened to the sounds on the other side.  I heard nothing.  I knocked on the door.  Still nothing.  I spoke loudly through the door.  "I'm going to open the door."

There was nothing.  Picking locks was easy with my ability.  It was one of the first skills I had learned when I started working in the City.  It's hard to hunt the monsters that think like a human if you can't get into places.

The door opened easily and I checked each room thoroughly before moving on to the next.  I checked under the couch for any sign of a phone or a computer.  Just in case they'd been left.

I looked through the cabinets, and closets.  Each room was empty.  The phone wasn't on this floor.

Walker had no luck on the first floor either, he was moving to the basement.  I was moving up to the third and last floor.

The third floor was empty as well.  The phone hadn't moved which meant Walker was in the correct place.  But we hadn't heard anything over the comms.  "Sage, how is Walker doing?"

Sage didn't answer.  Fuck!  I took the stairs all the way down.  I tried to raise either Walker or Sage but I couldn't get through to either of them.  They had to be jamming the signal now that we were there.  

I found the stairs to the basement and started down.  I made a ramp of air down instead of using the creaky planks going down.  I made no noise as my feet never touched the wood.  Another trick I had learned.  A little more difficult to maintain on a regular path, but stairs were easy.

The floor at the bottom was concrete.  It was old and cracked.  I heard voices coming from the other room.  There wasn't a lot of places they could be in here.  The basement was full of machinery that ran the building, generators, boilers, that kinda thing.  Not really a good place to hole up for hacking.

I moved slowly through the shadows.  Beyond the stairs entrance a door was closed and a thin bar of light shown through.  I heard chains rattle to my left and I turned in time to see someone bolting out to attack me but the chains hindered their movement.  There was blood dripping from his mouth, I could see tiny fangs protruding from his face.  A caged vampire...  What the fuck was going on here?

There was a loud noise inside the closed room and I heard a voice yell, "Someone else is here!"  Followed by the sound of a fist hitting flesh.  "You said you were alone."

My first thought was they had gotten Walker.  I wove air and fire in front of me, I would be ready for whatever came out of that door.  Walker stared back at me.  There was a bloody bit mark on his neck and a hand was holding a gun to his head from behind him.  A small hand held his belt buckle in front of him.  The nails were cut close to the finger like they'd been chewed on.  I could smell the fear radiating all around me.  The vampire was afraid now that the girl dragon had come out.  Walker feared for his life.  And he had every right to beleive he was going to die.  Vampire bites were fatal to Venatori.  Such a loss.  The girl behind him was even more afraid.

"Let him go.  He's dead anyway."  Fear opened Walker's eyes and I smiled at him to reassure him.  "He got bit.  You know Venatori die from vampire bites - wolves too."

She paused a moment.  I could almost feel the wheels turning inside her head.  I wish I could see more of her other than her hand and legs behind Walker's stance.  "You won't kill him."  she said confidently.  "I know who you are."

"Enlighten me." 

She peeked around Walker and I saw a deep brown eye lined with dark eye liner and mascara that was smudged, it looked like she'd been crying.  "You are local Venatori who doesn't kill innocents.  Everyone knows you."

"Woah!  I'm famous huh?" I grinned at her.  "Why don't we get on even footing and tell me who you are?"  I widened my smile.

She looked back at me with wide eyes contemplating the situation and her answer.  She shook her head, "You don't need to know my name."

"Okay.  I'll just call you Duckling then.  You need to let my friend go.  He's already in shock from the vampire venom.  He's going to die."

Walker added to my words.  "Just shoot me Nox.  Kill us both."  He looked like he was about to puke.  He was ashen and his eyes were watering and red.  He actually looked like he believed what he was say. But I had no intention of killing either of them.  

She looked back at me and frowned.  She pushed Walker away from me and pointed the gun at me.  Walker staggered away from her and crouched down with his hand to his neck.  I wove elements around his neck and stuffed the bite with elements like I had when I'd been bitten.  I don't know how long he'd been bitten.  Hell I didn't know if it'd work but I knew I had to try.  Walker didn't know the difference as he felt himself dying in the shadows of the basement.

I opened myself to Ant.  It was one of those things I could just feel.  I called him and hoped he could hear me.  It was still the middle of the day and he was weaker now with the sun nearly at it's peak.  But I couldn't worry about it.  I looked at the girl with a smile.  "Well, Duckling, that's better.  You and I can talk now."

"Why are you here?"  She asked.

"To stop you from what you are doing.  What are you doing?"

She shook her gun at me.  "I'm the one asking the questions.  How did you find me?"

"A friend of mine found you."

"I heard The Wicked Truth was helping the feds.  He lead you here?"  she asked.

I shook my head.  "I don't know any Wicked Truth. Is that some kinda code name?"  I asked with a grin.

"He's a white hat called Truth.  He was Wicked before he got busted.  He's been poking around.  He's the only reason why you'd find me.  Damn technopaths!"

Sage didn't even know he was a technopath, but this dragon did.  "Duckling, if you can keep The Wicked Truth from your game you must be pretty big on the playing field."

She laughed.  "I suppose.  You need to go.  I have to get back to work or he'll let him go."  She nodded towards the chained vampire.

I wrapped the vampire up in bonds of air and he looked at me with wide eyes as he could no longer move.  "Duckling, I'd worry about me and not this baby vampire."  I formed a flaming ball above my hand.  "See, I need you to stop harming the human world.  And I need you to come with me.  I don't want to kill you, but I will if I have to.  Emerson found that out the hard way."

The girl paled and the gun dipped just a little as she regained herself.  But it was enough of a slip that I had moved in and taken the gun from her with a quick move of my near human speed and my ability.  She was lying on the ground with my knee at her throat unable to breathe.  "You can't spit fire at me if you can't take a breath."  I smiled as I gagged the girl and got up with her hands still in mine.  "You need to come with me."

I spoke over the comms.  "Love, you can give the feds the location, but I'm taking the occupants.  Basement is will be clear of all danger to humans once I leave.  Walker is down, I need to get him to the Infirmary.  I'll be in touch."

Sage laughed.  "You really don't want to confirm who I am to our little friend?"

I shook my head but knew he couldn't see it.  "No, I don't."

"Danny, and a team are on their way to the location.  He said to leave the computer equipment."

"Done.  I will give him an update soon as we have a story to sell."  I sighed. "I'll catch you later."

In the shadows I felt a presence appear.  "Bout time you showed up.  Got a baby vamp for you to take care of.  I need to get Walker home.  He's been bit."

Ant looked over at Walker who was looking a little less pallid than before, maybe the resources were helping.  Maybe vampire bites didn't need to be fatal.  One could only hope.

I helped Walker up and took the dragon by the bonds of air and dragged her with me.  Ant took the vampire by his elbow and it instantly calmed down.  "Hey Nox.  Let me get you home faster."

I frowned but nodded.  "Okay."

He grabbed my elbow with his other hand and we shadow walked into the alleyway behind the AU Building.  A place I knew well.  I jumped into the very alley way on many occassions.  It was seculded even on the most sunny days.  Ant frowned at me as i bent over trying to keep what little I'd eaten down.  "Thanks, man.  Let me know what's going down.  The Council and Elders won't be happy once they find out the dragons had one of us chained up and starved."

"I will let you know Ant.  Thanks for the ride."  I grinned.

Ant chuckled as he stepped back into the shadows and was gone.

After we all recovered we were inside and in headquarters via the service elevators we'd brought Naomi and Gordon in on.  It was almost deja vu except Walker was still not up to par.

"Go to the Infirmary.  I got this part.  I'll be there when I'm done."

Walker didn't even hesitate as I got off on the right floor and he continued on up.

The floor was quiet.  Oddly so.  I walked with the girl dragon in front of me in her gag and bonds and she looked defeated.  "If you cooperate you might make it out alive."  I doubted it.  I'd not seen any of my captures freed after a trial.  A few had been sent to their own kind to be dealt with but it was usually just as harsh a punishment as we'd dole out - death was the common cure for all things malevolent in the supernatural world.

I took the girl to the fishbowl and shut her in with a wall of air before knocking on Dae'lin's door.  She opened the door and frowned at me.  "Another one?"

"We need answers.  She might help.  Emerson wasn't going to talk.  I didn't give her the option yet."  I said flatly.

Dae'lin sighed.  "Go talk to her."

I did as I was instructed and let down the wall of air to enter and promptly replaced it.  I unwound her gag but not the bonds.  "Just kill me."  she said once her mouth was free.  "That's what they are going to do anyway."

I took a seat opposite of her. "You possess a skill we could use.  You seem keen on breaking the law for The Dragon.  Help us find him, maybe they'll let you out on a short leash if you work for us."

She laughed.  "Doubtful, you don't use other species for help." 

I smiled. "They don't, but I know a vampire who does.  Il Cane actually likes to have options.  She needs Chevalier to keep her from the technological advances. But she hunts just the same as I do."

"You know too many hackers for being daft."

I laughed.  "Call me lucky.  I know too many vampires and werewolves too for being Venatori.  I get around, what can I say?"  I grinned at her brushing my crimson painted fingernails against my shirt clearly bragging.

She rolled her eyes at me.  "What do you want?"

"I need The Dragon's location."

"I don't know where he is.  I've never met him.  Only that rat wolf Valentino."  She said.

"Well Duckling.  Can you find him?  He had to contact Valentino some how didn't he?  We've not uncovered that yet. Can you get all the calls to Valentino's cell?  You have his number."

"Why don't you get The Wicked Truth to do it or Chevalier if you know them."  She spit out at me.

"Because I'm asking you.  See, they are all on good standing with me.  You, not so much.  I'm giving you a reason to get into my good graces."

She sighed.  "Fine.  Give me a computer."

"I'll get you a computer and a watch dog.  I can't have you telling The Dragon we are coming for him."

"Fine."  she said.  "Can you untie now?"

"Not right now.  But when everything's in place I will."  I stood up and walked out.  I pulled out my phone and I called Sage.  

He promptly picked up, "Nox! I didn't expect to hear from you so soon."

"I missed you too." I grinned.  "Can you come to the AU building.  I need you to watch the girl while she tracks down The Dragon for me."

"I could do that for you without the babysitting."  He sounded hurt.

"I know you could.  But she knows The Dragon.  She'll know what she has you might not.  I've plenty of things you can work for me that I'd trust you with before her.  If you are interested in more than babysitting."

Sage nodded.  "I don't think your bosses will like you giving me work."

I laughed.  "I don't care.  I need to you bring a bare bones powerful laptop.  Something she can use but she can't do much more on."

"I can do that.  But she can install anything she wants."  

"I got you watching her."  I smiled.  "Come to the twenty-ninth floor and someone will bring you to me if I can't get there."

"See you soon."  Sage hung up and I was left with a little dead air before I went about the rest of my walk.

I took the stairs up the two flights to the Infirmary to find Walker.  He was my next priority.

There was a woman at the nurses station out front and I stopped to ask her.  "Do you know where Walker Moore is right now?  He came in with a vampire bite."

Her face paled and she looked up from what she was doing.  "I'd gather he's in the morgue now."

"Can you look please?  He came in alive."  I asked slightly annoyed and letting it show in my face and my voice.  

She sighed and rolled her eyes but looked in the system and gasped.  "He's in ICU, room 236."

"Thank you."  I smiled at her and flourished her a bow.

I didn't wait to see what her reaction was as I turned around and went up to the next floor.  I was immediately stopped by a nurse, "Who are you here to see?"

"Walker Moore."  I said with a smile.

"Only family can see him here."  She pointed at the door, "And you are not family."

"He's my partner, come on.  I just want to check on him I won't be long."  I pleaded.

She took pity on me.  "Alright.  Where you there when he got bit?"

I shook my head.  "We'd split up.  I saw him afterwards, while he was being held hostage."

"He's right in there.  Don't be long."  She scowled as she left.

Walker was wearing a paper gown and sitting up in bed with an IV bag strung up next to him.  He wasn't dead - he looked better than last I'd seen him.  He nodded towards the door, "Shut the door."

I complied with a question written all over my face.  He quickly waved me over and whispered, "Did you do something after she let me go?  I mean to me."

I nodded.  "Yeah what I did the last time I got bit by a vampire.  Fed the wound elements.  Why?" I grinned at him.

"They say that I should be dead.  But here I am.  You made me a freak of nature."  He laughed.  "So this is how it feels like huh?"

I grinned.  "I suppose.  I didn't heal you.  You healed you.  I gave your body the resources to produce the antibodies needed to counter act the vampire bite faster than the poison could attack your system.  At least that's my theory."

Walker waved a hand over his head.  "Yeah, I so don't get it."

"You are going to be okay? I was worried." 

Walker nodded.  "Yeah, thanks to you.  You need to make a report on this.  Write a white paper or whatever they call them and submit it to the Venatori medical journals.  Cesari could be doing so much more than just being Scrin and teaching.  It opens up doors."

I shrugged.  "I don't know if it has to be Cesari.  Four single elemental could potentially yield the same results."

"I'll be okay.  Go back to whatever you were doing."  Walker said.

I laughed.  "I'm waiting The Wicked Truth to arrive so he can babysit the hacker girl.  She's going to find The Dragon for us."

"Why didn't you let Sage just do that for us?"

I smiled.  "I have something else in mind for him."

"Like what?"  Walker asked curiously.

I smiled again.  "Like cleaning up the mess we made.  If he does a good job maybe we'll use his abilities more often."

Walker laughed.  He almost feel out of the hospital bed he was laughing so hard.  "Making it so he has to see you huh?"

I grinned.  "No.  I think he'd enjoy a little more secrecy to his job than working for the government strictly.  He's like us.  What would you do if you got stuck with a desk job?  That's basically what he's doing.  And he's a technopath.  He needs the right outlet."

Walker shook his head. "You are too practical.  Why can't you just admit you want your boy toy around all the time."

I laughed.  "While that is 100% correct, I do want him around.  He's not my boy toy and I want to make him happy.  He loves doing what he does.  I can give him more of that."

I moved towards the door.  "I should go."  I opened the door and stepped out.  "Your nurse wasn't too happy I showed up not being family and all." 

Walker nodded.  "Don't go killing anyone without me."  He grinned.  "And think about that paper.  I'm sure Vega can give you some pointers on that."

I sighed.  "I'll think about it."

When I got back to Dae'lin's office and the fish bowl Sage was talking with Dae'lin in her office.  I stood outside the open door half listening but mostly watching Sage gesture with his hands and speaking quickly.

Dae'lin waved for me to join them and Sage turned to who she was beckoning and his face light up with a smile.  I grinned back at him.  I reached for Sage's waist and lightly hung my thumb on his back pocket.  "What can I do for you Dae'lin?"

"Your friend..."  She looked out my arm behind him and then turned to look up at me with a small blush on her cheeks.  "He was just informing me he couldn't make the changes we need."

"What changes are those?" I asked.  I had every intention of talking Sage into helping us frame Emerson for the hacking, but I had every intention of doing it with finesse and not bludgeoning him over the head like Dae'lin was prone to do with me.

"The human authorities need a fall guy, we have a dead man.  We need the two linked together.  I figured if you trust him enough to watch the dragon do a job, then he's trust worthy enough to do that."  Dae'lin said.

"He is.  But I'm sure you tactfully put it and just didn't say here's what you need to do?"  I rolled my eyes.

I pulled on Sage's pocket.  "Let me talk to him."

Sage laughed. "I am standing right here you know."

I kissed his check.  "I know.  Come with me beautiful."  I winked at Dae'lin and took Sage out of her office and into a quieter hallway.

He was looking at me with an amused look, the sparkle in his eyes told me he was interested in what I had to say.  I leaned against the wall with one shoulder and crossed my arms in front of me.  I wanted to touch him, which meant that would be a bad thing right now.  I needed to not persuade him with sex.  This wasn't about us.

He laughed and mimiced my pose.  "Okay.  Speak then."

"Dae'lin told you what needed to happen?"  I asked.

"Yeah.  I can't do it.  I'll get fired - then I'll go to jail."  Sage said flatly.

"If I can work around that for you?"

"How are you going to do that?"  Sage asked incredulously.  "You don't have that kinda clout here, what makes you think the US government is going to just let you do this?"

"Sage, love, we've been doing this for countless millennia - hiding in the shadows is what we do.  I can get you authorized access to get into secure servers."

"If you have that access why me?  Why jeapordize my freedom?"  He was getting angry.

"You like what you do?"  I asked.  "White hatting companies firewalls, finding the holes and then reporting it?"

Sage frowned.  "It's legal work."

"Is that what you want?"  I asked.

"You are asking me to break the law."  Sage said.

"I am.  Human law."  

"I am Human."  Sage spat at me.

"So am I but I'm not too.  Which is the same for you."  I said softly.  "You were raised by wolves.  You're a technopath.  You are of our world just by that alone, but Danny found you and he raised you as a wolf."

"So?"

"The Clandestine Providence governs human law even though human's don't really know it.  It is our job as gifted beings to protect the humans.  What do you think would happen if the humans find out that a dragon who runs a gang is trying to make humanity fall?  Or that the finest research facilities in New York City - the same ones who are searching for a cure for cancer - are run by supernatural creatures who feed on human blood.  Il Cane is not just the vampires enforcer - she funds things for humans.  The Night Life building is centered around vampires getting services needed to live a human life - but humans on the night shift benefit from it as well."

I sighed.  "I know I'm asking a lot of you.  I'm asking you too choose a side.  Join me, us, in protecting humanity or live in the ignorance that you were once part of."

"You can't make me forget any of this."  Sage said.

"No, I can't.  But I know someone who could.  I know someone who could erase your life with Danny and Rosie and give you a normal human one.  No wolves, just your path ability.  I can't take that from you.  We can give you the life you want without any of this shit.  It's rare that we do this.  But we can."

Sage sank to the floor, "Why can't I just stay this way and not work for your people."

I sat down next to him.  "I don't think you could handle the ramifications of my life.  I wouldn't be able to stay in your life.  I can't protect you in your world.  Erasing me from your life would probably save you a lot of heartache."

"I don't know about that.  Forgetting you could be devastating."  Sage joked but it was laced with venom.

"I'm sorry.  I should never have asked you to do this for me."  I stood up.  "Thank you for the laptop.  I'll have someone else babysit."    I started to walk away feeling broken inside.

Sage called out, "Nox."  I stopped but I didn't turn around.  He sighed.  "Would you give up everything to be with me? Would you pretend to be human for me?"

I took a deep breath and nodded. "I would.  And I can. If it means you'll stay with me forever."  I walked forward and turned the corner.  I could feel the anxiety level rising from the question.  I'd thought about so many times and the anxiety always made me cringe in fear.  I wanted to get away from it away from the question and the answer.  I needed some fresh air I couldn't breathe.

I was almost to Dae'lin's office when I felt Sage grab my arm.  He turned me violently around.  "You would give up all this for me?  To be something you aren't?"

I nodded.  "I would.  And I can.  All I have to do is exile myself from the Venatori.  I can't come back.  My children can't come back without jumping through major hoops.  I can forfeit everything I know and live a human existence.  Others before me have done it."

"What would you do?"

I shrugged.  "I dunno.  Go to college get a degree?  I could be a cook or a fitness trainer.  I don't have any formal training in any of it but I could do what needed to be done if someone was there to help me start out."

"You've thought about it before haven't you?"

I smiled.  "Every time Aaron throws my tray across the table, and every time someone thinks me bringing in the monsters is a wrong thing.  So it's a pretty weekly thing for me."

Sage asked.  "Would you do it for me?"

"Would you?  Give up everything for me?"  I smiled softly at him, "I'd give my life to make you happy Sage.  So giving up my world is nothing."

"Why would you do that?  We hardly know each other?"

I took a deep breath.  "Because I learned to trust my gut a long time ago.  You brighten my day just by being near.  You see me.  Not the image I put out.  You see around it.  It doesn't scare you.  I need that.  I need you.  Leaving you is going to be hardest fucking thing I've ever done in my life."  I turned and walked away again.

Sage fell into step beside me and took my hand.  "I'll help you.  It's not illegal if you have access."

I shook my head.  "No, Sage.  It's alright.  It's selfish of me to want you to do this.  I get it now.  I'm not going to ask you to choose between me and that.  I'd like you to babysit her.  But that's all.  I won't ask you to do something you don't want to do if you don't ask me to what we just talked about."

Sage laughed and stopped.  He pulled me in against his body with a smile.  "That's a deal."  He pressed his lips over mine and I sank into his embrace.  I let out a little whimper and collapsed against him.  He caught me and the kiss broke, "You okay?"

I could feel Dae'lin standing outside her door waiting for my answer.  I nodded but I couldn't say anything.  

Dae'lin spoke softly, "Bring him in here.  He just had a panic attack.  He'll be fine."



# Tracking Down the Dragon

Sage had helped me into Dae'lin's office and sat me down in one of her office chairs.  I leaned forward with my head between my knees.  Sage was squatting in front of me looking at me with concern.  I smiled wryly at him trying to reassure him.  But I knew it wasn't working.

"You alright?"

I nodded.  I didn't speak. I wanted to tell Sage that I was okay, that I was good.  I would be okay.  My mind was just over reacting to change to the possibility that my life was going to be completely changed.  The world had been fine until that moment.  Until I had realized with every amount of certainty that I would up root my life to be with him.

Sage's hands were on my knees waiting for me to compose myself.  I reached out and took his hands in mind and pulled him against me.  Sage knelt on the floor between my legs and we were nearly at eye level as I kissed him.  "Change has always been hard."  I whispered after we broke apart.  "I want to be with you and it was a moment of panic realizing I'd do everything I said I would to be with you and I'd never regret it.  But that doesn't mean it doesn't scare the shit out of me."

Sage grinned.  "We aren't making any changes.  Just be with me.  That's enough for me."

"It's enough for me."  I kissed Sage.  Someone cleared their throat in the doorway and we broke apart Sage pressed his face to my chest and took a deep breathe.  It was probably a little embarrassment and a lot more taking comfort in my smell.  I wanted to do the same but I looked up ant saw Dorian standing with a smile.  

"You alright?"  Dorian asked.

"I'm alright.  I have a good man to help me through all this shit."  I smiled up at Dorian then whispered in Sage's ear, "We probably should get to work.  You got that laptop?"

Sage nodded and then kissed me on the neck before he stood up and patted the bag under his arm.  "Two laptops, mine and one for her."  Sage offered me his hand.

I smiled and took it and we followed Dorian out of Dae'lin's office.  Sage squeezed my fingers.  I glanced over at him and he smiled then pulled me closer wrapping his arm around my waist instead of holding my hand.  His hand hung from my belt loop and his fingers wrapped around my hip.  He pressed his hip against mine and we walked.  Sage grinned at me and I couldn't help but smile back at him.  How did I get so lucky to find a guy like him? 

We walked past the fish bowl and Sage stopped.  "That's a dragon?"

I nodded.  "You know her?"

Sage nodded.  "She frequents The Den.  I don't feel other's magic like you do but she always gave off shifter magic vibe.  I know her as Trix."

"So she knows you?" I asked.

Dorian kept walking with a wave.  He had things to do.  He had only come to help me.  I yelled after him.  "Dorian."  He turned and looked at me with a smile and bright blue eyes.  "Thanks for checking on me.  I'll stop by later and we can talk about it."

Dorian laughed.  "I don't think you need my help anymore, Nox.  I think Sage has you well in hand.  But the two of you should stop by for a glass of wine and maybe dinner.  If you feel like cooking."

I nodded.  "We will sometime.  May not be soon, depends on this case."

Dorian nodded.  "Always working.  You are both welcome anytime."  He smiled and turned back down the hall to head back to the Academy where he worked.

Sage had waited patiently for our exchange.  He smiled at me.  "Dinner sounds good.  Maybe I can meet your dad too?"

I grinned.  "I don't know if Dorian would like my father to be in the same room with us.  But we'll get Kai to come around so you can meet him proper."  I nodded towards the girl in the fish bowl.  "She knows Truth?"

Sage nodded.  "She knew Wicked too."

I grinned.  "So she knows The Wicked Truth.  She knew of Chevalier too."

Sage grinned.  "Everyone knows Chevalier who's any good at what we do.  Some say he's as old as computers are and has been hacking them for that long.  Other's say it's just a bunch of guys using the name."

I laughed.  "Which one do you think it is?"  

"Well until yesterday, I would have said he was just a bunch of different guys using the name, but I know better now.  He's the human servant of a vampire and immortal, or at least that's what I understand now."

I nodded.  "Yes.  Cari could let him go and he'd live out his mortal existence, but I doubt Jack Wynn will ever leave Cari's side."

"Is she that good?"  Sage asked.

"She's a very good master.  He makes more money than he could hacking any day.  And he gets to live forever watching technology grow until it kills us all.  He's in heaven."

Sage nodded.  "Shall we go acquaint ourselves then?"

I lead Sage to the door and let him the other side of the air wall and closed the two of us on the inside with the dragon hacker.  I smiled at her.  "Well, Trix.  Here is a computer, and  your babysitter."

She gave Sage a frown.  "I didn't expect you to actually know who The Wicked Truth was.  Or Chevalier.  But you know them both?"  She turned to look at me.

I nodded and I kissed Sage's cheek.  "I know them both."  I winked at her.

Sage sat down next to Trix and slid her a laptop.  "It should be powerful enough."  Sage pulled out his own laptop but kept the lid closed.  He looked up at me.  "We'll need a hard line to your internet."

I nodded to the wall behind them.  "Should be a cable back there.  You both need a hard line?"

Sage nodded.  "Yeah."

I picked up the phone in the conference room and dialed the basement.  

A boy answered.  "IT.  How can I help you?"

"Nate.  I need an Ethernet hub up here in the fishbowl.  I need two hard lines."

Nate was my nephew.  He was my half-sister's eldest son.  He was a Monroe but Iris was a Monroe which tied Nate to the Viddens family through blood.  He sighed.  "When?"

"As soon as possible.  I have two hackers working a case and they don't want a wireless connection." 

"Alright.  I'll bring one up.  I have to take some other things up to HQ anyway."  Nate said as he hung up.

"We'll have a hub in a few minutes.  Get comfortable."  I sat down opposite the two hackers and swiveled in my chair like a child.  Sage chuckled and on one turn I saw Trix rolling her eyes at me.

Ten minutes late a dark haired boy walked into the fishbowl.  Or rather he walked into the wall of air.  I winced when I hard the flesh hit the wall.  "Sorry, my bad."

Nate came in rubbing his nose.  "That's so wrong."

"I'm sorry."

He grinned at me with his crooked smile and green eyes.  "I should let you hang for this Uncle Nox."

I laughed.  He was the only one of the older nephews and nieces that actually called me that.  Darin was Nate's little brother and he'd called me Uncle Nox since he could speak.  But he was 6 now.  He'd been a baby when I first met my father.  "Well.  I do have a bad guy to catch so do whatever you need.  I'll just have Dae'lin call your boss and get it done that way."

The boy paled.  Nate shook his head.  "That's not necessary.  It's right here.  Let me get you set up."

He moved around to the other side of the table where Sage and Trix sat.  He looked at them with wary eyes.  "Which one's the dragon?" he asked.

"Guess." I said.

Nate shook his head.  "I can't tell magic from another, they both possess something."

Sage offered Nate his hand.  "The Wicked Truth."  He nodded towards me.  "He thinks I'm his boyfriend."

Nate took Sage's hand, "Nathaniel Monroe.  Are you?"

Sage grinned.  "Something like that I suppose."

Nate was a smart kid.  "So you must be the dragon."  He indicated Trix, he offered her his hand.  "A pleasure to meet you.  I've never met a dragon before."

"Until today I'd never met a Venatori.  You are the most polite one I've met so far."  Trix said.  "You can call me Vicky."

Nate grinned.  "Don't let Nox bother you, he's just all talk."  Nate went back to work plugging in the hub and provided two more Ethernet cables for the two hackers.  "Here you go.  Two hard lines.  Good luck!"

"Uncle Nox, Mom said you need to cook dinner for the family soon.  Not just us, but everyone.  A real family dinner.  She said you were the only one qualified."  Nate said at the door.

I laughed.  "Tell her to put it on my schedule and I'll be there.  We can plan the menu after we get a solid date."

Nate's eyes went wide.  "Really?  Even Uncle Adam?"

"He's my half-brother we might as well try to get along."  I said.  "You get everyone in one place and I'll cook.  One big happy family."

Nate's smile was bright.  "I'll tell mother.  She'll be just as surprised."  He literally skipped out the door.

I looked to the girl dragon and smiled.  "Trix you wanna get started?"

She smiled back.  "You could have used my name."

I shrugged.  "You didn't introduce yourself to me.  And I have no intention of telling you Truth's real name so I figure I'll stick to your handle as well."

Sage grinned at me.  "She's working on setting up."  He turned his laptop for me to see and he was networked into whatever she was doing.  "I got a visual of everything she's doing.  What do you want me to do?"

"Just babysit I guess."  I smiled at him. "It's about all I got right now.  Work with her if you see that you can."

Sage sighed and walked around the table and sat down next to me.  He pulled his laptop closer so he could see and turned my chair to him and leaned closer.  I leaned in so he could whisper as that was the vibe he was giving me.  "Nox.  I can do whatever you need me to do."

I grinned at him and whispered, "My Wicked Truth.  I don't want to get you in trouble.  You know what I need.  You do what you think you can do for me without compromising your morals."

Sage was grinning at me.  "Your Wicked Truth?"

"Yes.  Mine."  I smiled

"I like that."  Sage kissed my check and turned back to his laptop.  "Let me see what I can do."

I whispered, "Don't compromise yourself for me.  Are we clear?"

Sage nodded.  "I understand."

Sage and Trix started working and the only sound in the room was that of typing. 

After twenty minutes Trix broke the verbal silence.  "Can I get some Mountain Dew and chocolate?"

I nodded.  "You want anything Truth?"

"Coffee, please."

"Alright.  I'll get you some hacker food."  I stood up and left the room.   

I knocked on Dae'lin's door.  "I need to get some caffeine for the computer geeks to make progress.  Someone needs to make sure Truth stays safe."

Dae'lin nodded.  "I'll watch him myself."  She opened the door and removed the air weave and replaced it with her own.  She sat down at the head of the table and watched the progress while I headed down to the cafeteria.

I ordered a pizza from the cefetria in addition to picking up mountain dew, chocolate and coffee.  I also picked up a few protein bars as it might be awhile for anything else other than that.  I didn't mind being an errand boy.  But I would prefer to remain with Sage while he was in the presense of an enemy dragon.

Dae'lin and Sage were chatting when I walked in.  She smiled up at me.  "Your friend here has found a legal means of fixing our problem."  She stood up and shook Sage's hand.  "Thank you Truth.  You certainly are a useful person to have around."

I put down a bottle of Mountain Dew for Trix and the chocolate she asked for.  I'd actually gotten M&M's, Milk and Dark Chocolate for her to choose from since I wasn't sure what she wanted.  I gave Sage his coffee and he smiled back at me.  "I ordered pizza for later - figured everyone ate pizza."

Trix just smiled and sipped at her drink.  "He's hard to find.  Truth I could use your help."

Sage looked at the screen that was her and nodded.  There was no small talk as the two hackers started back again at their jobs.

I sat down and watched Sage.  I didn't really understand anything that was going on.  But I could see the patterns in the code.  The way things returned.  How his gift manipulated the data stream as it left his fingers.  He manipulated the computer as much as he did the code.  It made me wonder how much of it was his knowledge or his gift.

I put my hand on his shoulder and he glanced at me.  "I have a question when you have a moment."

Sage finished up.  He nodded. "What's up?"

"Do you know you are using your ability?  I mean are you knowingly manipulate the machine while you are writing code?"

Sage looked at me with a questioning look and shook his head.  "I guess not since I'm not doing anything different since I found out I was a technopath."

I nodded.  "I can find you a technopath to show you."

"If you like.  I guess it would be good to know what's going on."  Sage smiled.

I stood up and let them get back to work.  "I'm just going to be outside the door."  I stepped outside and let the glass door close behind me.  I called the one person who I knew could help Sage in the long run.  I could have called Ant to get us in touch, but then I'd have to explain to Ant and he'd have to explain to Jack and then it wouldn't necessarily translate right.

So I dialed Jack's personal number.  He answered, "You know I'm in Italy right?"

"Yes, Jack I know.  I've a question/favor to ask of you of a personal nature not business related."

"Color me intrigued.  Let me guess you want me to hook you up with Truth."  Jack giggled over the line.

"Actually, no.  I managed that all on my own well before you introduced me." 

"So Ant tells me.  What do you want then?"  Jack asked.

"My Wicked Truth is a technopath.  But he was never taught control or even what he's doing.  He eventually managed to take control of his power and stop damaging everything, but he's clueless to it.  He didn't know until I said something."

Jack sighed.  "His parents should have taught him.  It's a recessive genetic trait.  The likely hood of it transmitting into a family without the knowledge of what they are is very rare, even if it skips a generation."

I nodded knowingly.  "His parents died when he was three.  He bounced around foster care systems until he got caught hacking, and his adoptive parents took him in and later adopted him."

"Fuck!" Jack blurted out.  "Yeah.  I can help him when I get back.  But I don't know how much help I'm going to be if he's already using it."

"Show him how you use it.  Teach him to see it.  He doesn't know what he's doing it's instinctive, don't change that, just help him see it."  I said.

Jack laughed.  "I've always wanted to meet the Wicked Truth in person.  I hear he's hot."

I rolled my eyes.  "He is.  He's mine."

Jack laughed.  "We'll see about that.  Maybe he'd make a good master."

"Jack, he's mine."  I said flattly.

"Yeah, yeah.  You won't share?"  He joked.

"Not on your life."  I smiled. "Thank you Jack.  I owe you."

Jack laughed.  "Me personally?"

I nodded. "Yes Jack.  I owe you.  Not Cari, not Ant - you!"

"Wow!  A Venatori favor of my very own.  I know what I can ask of you, but I won't - not yet anyway.  I might think up something else."  Jack hung up the phone before I could comment on it.  Jack's sort of payment could be very dangerous.

I went back into the fishbowl and sat down next to Sage.  He grinned at me, "What was that about?"

"Told you I'd find you a technopath.  He's in Italy right now but when he gets back he said he'd help."

Sage turned to look at me, "You mean Chevalier is a technopath."

I nodded.  "Yeah.  He is."

"I thought other magic didn't work on human paths."  Sage said confused.

"That's true most of the time.  I think that most species don't want to contaminate themselves with human magic honestly that's what the Aeternus did when they created the Venatori.  Primeval vamps and the First therians and the dragons really, don't want to dilute their lines with the mortality of the human race."  I grinned.  "But that's my theory."

Sage asked, "So you think, if they'd tried I could have been a wolf?"

I shrugged.  "Yeah.  But we'll never know.  Unless that's what you want?"

Sage shook his head. "I think I have a problem turning furry once a month."

I grinned.  "Nothing wrong with turning furry once a month.  It comes with other advantages as well."

"Are you trying to talk me into it?"  Sage laughed.

"Not at all.  I'm just saying if the only thing you see as a negative is turning furry once a month then there might be room for Danny and Adrian to convince you otherwise."

Sage shook his head.  "Maybe before I met you I might have taken the risk.  But I don't want to die now."

I grinned.  "Well I'd help you through it if you wanted me there.  But all in all it's your decision and I'm happy with you the way you are so I'm not trying to talk you into anything."

Sage nodded and stared at his screen like he was thinking.  I didn't know what he was thinking about - and I wasn't about to ask.  It was his decision.

Trix and Sage worked on the task at hand until pizza arrived when they both took a break to eat.  They two hackers chatted back and forth and I listened.  I felt very much like an outsider and a jailer.  I wasn't part of their world and I didn't understand.  But I wasn't going to leave Sage alone with someone who could potentially harm him.

I wasn't bored.  I had plenty to entertain me while they worked.  I tried to follow Sage's screen but I still got lost in things.  He'd look over at me and explain what they were doing like he was teaching some other hacker.  I wasn't always sure he was talking to me but most of the time he was.  I could tell by the tone of his voice - soft and caring and trying to help me understand.

It was the thought that counted.  I didn't understand and really my simple minded brain wasn't connecting on the totality of it all.  But I understood the repetitive patterns of their tasks.  I enjoyed watching Sage.  The way his hands moved across his keyboard.  The way he scrunched his nose when he was thinking hard and trying to focus on something.

He would catch me staring at him and blush slightly before going back to work.  But he never said anything.  But even that got boring after a while.  I started playing with patterns juggling balls of air and fire to kill time.  Watching them mingle and dissipate as I let them fizzle out.  

I found Sage and Trix watching me as the last ball popped out over my head.  Trix laughed, "He's a clown."

Sage chuckled.  "We have a place."

"Why didn't you say something?"  I asked.

Trix laughed.  "We were going to until you started playing games, and it looked like you were having so much fun we didn't want to distract you."

Sage smiled as I looked at him for confirmation.  "You were just too cute oblivious to everything else."

I preened under the admission and grinned at him.  "Of course I was.  That's no excuse.  Well?"

Trix said.  "He's got a lot of business all around.  He's currently at the Empire State Building office."  She popped an M&M into her mouth and smiled.  "Am I done now?"

I smiled at her.  "For now.  Play nice and I'll be back in a moment."

I looked at Sage.  "You feel safe?"

Sage nodded.  "She won't hurt me.  Besides there are like ten Venatori standing around watching us at all times."

I frowned.  "Sorry.  Trix, I promise a deal.  No death sentence.  Even if I have to make you leave the country."

Trix frowned but nodded.  I smiled.  "I do thank you.  Let me do my thing and I'll be back."

They both nodded and started typing away at their computers again.  I think they were talking about me but whatever.  I left them both in an unprotected room and hoped that no one would hurt either of them while I wasn't watching them.  I stepped into Dae'lin's office and smiled.  "They got a location.  We need to stop him before he finds out Trix turned on him."

Dae'lin nodded and was on the phone.  I spoke while she dialed.  "I'm going to go see Walker.  Keep an eye on the dynamic duo please."

Dae'lin nodded and started her conversation on the other side of the phone.  I headed up to the Infirmary, but I stopped wondering if Sage wanted to come with me.  I turned back and found that there was another hunter in the room with the two hackers.

I opened the door and the conversation stopped.  The man looked at me and raised his hands in self defense. "I'm just a techy.  Hoping they can help me."

"Trix you want to help him?"  I asked.

"Isn't that why I'm here?  To make myself useful."  

I smiled.  "Add it to good behavior.  Truth, you want to come with me to check on Walker?"

Sage stood up immediately.  "Yes.  I need to stretch my legs."

I nodded to the tech guy.  "There are others watching if you feel threatened, but I think Trix here understands the deal."

He nodded and sat down next to her and they resumed their conversation.  I held the door for Sage and he stepped out of the fishbowl into the hallway, taking my hand as he passed by.

I grinned over at him as we walked.  "You like touching me don't you?" I asked him.

He smiled.  "Yes, but it's more for you than me"

"Me?"  I asked curious.

"Yeah.  You've been eying me all afternoon and keeping your hands to yourself.  I figured I'd reward your accomplishment."

I grinned at him.  "I can handle that."

I lead Sage to the stair well and we went up one flight before I stopped on the landing between floors and pushed Sage up against the wall.  He grinned at me.  "I was wondering how long it would take you before you did that."  He laughed.

Sage leaned forward and kissed me.  He turned me around and I was pressed up against the wall my hands above my head.  His face was close to mine when he pulled away.  "I think I like this view better."  Sage said.  "Stay this way for me." He trailed his fingers down my arms and I shuddered.  His hands payed with the hem of my shirt before he slipped his hands under my shirt.  My hands flexed above my head as I wanted to touch him but I obeyed.  Sage's fingers caressed the sides of my body and and abs.  He licked my lips and grinned.  "So pliant.  God, I'd love to do so much more right now."

My response came out in a hushed breathless whisper, "Why don't you?"


Sage laughed against my next.  "Because we are in a stairwell.  And you have a job to do."  Sage pulled away from me leaving my body cold and wanting.  I stayed where he'd put me and Sage grinned.  "So hot."  He licked his lips.  "So obedient too.  I think I like that more than I thought."  Sage held out his hand.  "Come on, let's go."

I sighed but I complied and took his hand. Shaking the blood back down into my arms.  "Does that bother you?"

I shook my head.  "No.  It's all part of the fun."

"You like when I take charge?"  Sage asked.

I smiled reassuringly.  "You know I do.  If it bothers you don't do it, Sage.  I'm happy either way."

Sage stopped me and pushed me against the side of the stair well, the railing pressing awkwardly into my back.  He grinned.  "I don't mind.  I like what it does to you."

I bit my bottom lip.  "What does it do to me, Sage?"

Sage laughed as he took a step back.  I remained with my back against the wall awkwardly and watched as Sage looked me up and down.  The look on his face told me he enjoyed my reaction very much.  My pants were getting tighter with each passing glance. "Mmmmm."  Sage shook his head bringing his eyes to rest on mine.  "What I'd love to do to you.  But..."  Sage sighed.  "Let's go see Walker."  He offered me his hand again and I took it with a smile.

I whispered softly, "My body is yours.  Anything and everything you wish to do to it is yours for the taking."

Sage laughed to cover the groan that had tried to escape.  "Work."

I grinned as I opened the door to the Infirmary floor Walker was on.  Sage never dropped my hand as we walked past the nurse's station and into Walker's room.

The IV drip from before was gone and Walker was actually up and pulling on a button up shirt over his well defined body.  Sage caught me looking and chuckled to himself.   He spoke first, "Glad to see you are up and about, Walker.  From the sounds of it you shouldn't be."

Walker laughed.  "I wouldn't be if it weren't for your boy's quick thinking.  Nox, really saved my bacon."

Sage grinned, "And a nice piece of bacon it is."

Walker turned around with red creeping up his face.  I wasn't sure if it was embarrassment or anger, or maybe a little of both.  But he saw the look on Sage's face and burst out laughing.  "I take it your boy toy was looking too hard at my nakedness."

Sage grinned.  "At least you were mostly dressed."

I rolled my eyes.  "I can't help noticing."

Walker laughed, "That's the kinda things that gets you into trouble, Nox."  Walker walked out of his hospital room and there were about three nurses who got up out of their chairs where they were working and rushed after him.  "Mr. Moore you can't leave."  one nurse said as she rushed after him.

I followed Walker and the nurses, Sage was still holding my hand as we walked behind them.  "I think he has other ideas."

We walked into the stair well and the nurses followed.  Walker walked all the way to Dae'lin's office before the nurses turned back in defeat.  Walker turned to us, "So what's on deck?"



# The Call of the Dragon

Dae'lin returned shortly after I explained my day to Walker.  How Trix and Truth had found best possible location of the man claiming to be The Dragon.  She smiled at Walker, "Good to see you walking around.  You'll have to tell us your secret."

Walker laughed.  "A good swift thinking partner."

Dae'lin looked at me and smiled then back to my partner.  "So are you intending to stay working together?" she asked.

I shrugged with a grin.  "Long as he doesn't slow me down."

Walker nodded.  "Ditto."

Dae'lin laughed.  "I never thought I'd see the day when Nox SÃ©tanta had a willing partner and willingly partnering with him.  And I mean that in so many senses of the word."  She looked towards Sage who was still holding my hand.  "As for you Truth, you and Trix are welcome to work with us anytime you feel the desire.  Well you are, Trix will work for us if she wishes to survive her criminal activities."

Sage smiled at her.  "My pleasure.  Though I think I'll limit my excursions to emergencies."

Dae'lin nodded.  "Emerson's death has been accepted in the morgue as an accident.  Thank you for the articles on spontaneous combustion, planting the evidence was easy.  As for our little hacker, we'll get her safe and secure and let her do her own clean up."

I grinned at Sage.  I hadn't asked what he'd helped Dae'lin with earlier, I guess I had just found out.

Dae'lin spoke.  "I also put out a feeler out to the vampires and wolves in the city and hope they can keep an ear out.  When I told them who was going in, even my squealers said they'd watch your back.  That's saying a lot, Nox.  What The Last Phoenix is doing is beyond just us.  The Dragon Council will be here within the day, so you need to catch him before they get here or he willÂ be lost to us."

I sighed.  "Do they know about Drake?"

Sage interrupted.  "I'll watch him, Nox. You do your thing, don't worry about the boy.  I'll make sure no one takes him."

I hugged Sage close and kissed the side of his head.  "Much appreciated.  No one I'd rather trust.  But if you need help Dorian or Kai can help."

"I've not met your father, I don't think I will ask for help from him."

Dae'lin took Sage by the elbow.  "Let me introduce you to Kai.  It's better if Nox isn't around. Trust me."

I sighed but nodded. "Yeah, oka,y fine.  Take Drake with you."

Dae'lin nodded.  "Good luck boys.  Come back safe and in one piece."

Walker went off a distance with Dae'lin, the pair giving Sage and I a moment alone in the hall.  Sage looked more concerned nowÂ that he was alone with me.  "I guess I will have to get use to you fighting the good fight, eh?"

I frowned but nodded.  "I'm a hunter.  This is what I do."

Sage nodded.  "I couldn't ask you to stop even if I wanted to.  It's like asking me to never touch a computer again.  And you have no idea how much that possibility hurt me."

"I'll come back safe."  I kissed him then whispered against his lips.  "I still have so much I want to do with you."  I wrapped my arms around my boyfriend and hugged him tight to my body whispering in his ear, "And so much of it has nothing to do with what I want to do to your body."

Sage laughed and pushed me awayÂ with a grin.  "You only want me for my body."

I winked at him.  "Damn straight."

"No such luck, love."  Sage said pulling me close and kissing me passionately.  I wanted to drown in him and had by the time he pulled away and was looking into my eyes with his bright blue sapphires.  "Stay safe.  I got your family here.  You don't worry about anything other than coming back."

Sage gave me a peck on the check and then walked away leaving me wanting more but knowing walking away was far harder than it looked, for both of us.

Walker was shaking his head as he approached me.  "It's hard when you have someone who cares about you that much."  He said as he turned me the other direction.  "I need to hit the armory."

I nodded and let Walker lead me to the secured area of the building where the weapons and other equipment was kept for such missions.

Walker grabbed dragon piercing rounds for his gun and a box for me.  "Where's yours?"

I sighed.  "In my room.  We can stop up there and grab it.  I don't like carrying Salvation and Damnation around the City unless I have to."

Walker laughed.  "You named your guns?"

I grinned.  "My gun and my knife.  Knife won't do much against a dragon but it's got other useful things too if necessary, a survival knife."

We retrieved my mundane weapons, and I loaded the weapon with dragon piercing rounds just in case.  Both held inÂ their holsters underneath my black leather jacket made for just that purpose.

And Walker and I were off to the Dragon's office.  We were off to fight a dragon, an honest to god real life dragon who claimed to be THE dragon.  As in the one who ruled them all.  But he wasn't, there was no such all-powerful dragon.  It was just a myth they liked to perpetrate to scare the masses.

Ye Pan had an office at the Empire State building, but he lived in an apartment a short distance away.  Both were not places we wanted to have a knock down drag out fight, but right now we were just scouting out the area.  Neither Walker nor I looked the part to just waltz into Mr. Pan's office and we looked like aÂ high end thug if we waited for him outside his high rise apartment building.  

Strike one for poor planning.  I stayed outside the Empire State building behind a veil with my phone silenced. I wasn't daft.  No one saw me while Walker went back home to become more presentable.
The street was crowded but everyone avoided me. Â The world passed me by without noticing I existed. The thought might have bothered me if I wasn't used to it already. Â While I waited, I saw Ye Pan leaving the building and walking towards the train station. I called Walker while I followed him down.  "He's on the move.  Track me."

I hung up after I said what I needed.  Pan got on the next train and I followed.  Still hidden by my veil, I had to be careful.  Dragon's could sense my magic because it was born of the same thing.  He got off the train and I let myself get lost in the crowd before I followed him up and about.

Trailing someone was never easy but in the city it was easier on foot.  Mr. Pan walked for several blocks before turning down an alleyway.  I opened myself to the surrounding magic.  I could feel dragons all around.  At least my magic would now blend in.  But I saw the shadow of The Dragon.  It was much larger than any I had seen before.  I could almost make out the green and bronze scales of his Chinese dragon form.  

The funny thing about the shadows though, they were always smaller than their true forms.  Which meant if Ye Pan shifted I would face a rather large reptile that could breathe fire and swallow me whole while barely batting an eye.  No pressure!

I didn't bother checking in with Walker.  He'd comeÂ eventually.  I followed at a safe distance behind my veil but even then I felt exposed, but the man never looked back, not even once.

He went into a creepy looking building.  The garage door opened as he approached and I knew this would be rough.  I had to run to catch up before the door closed on me.  I rolled underneath the closing metal door and skinned elbow against the ground pulling myself inside.  

The air was cooler inside and I had to move quickly or get walked on.  The place was full of people,Â mostly dragons.  But I felt a few other species running around, wolf and vampire, but sometimes the magic was hard to determine with this many so close together.

I followed Ye Pan through the crowd of people.  He found the stair case up and went to the second level of the two story warehouse.  Following him would be difficult.  At least if I were a human, but I used the same trick I did when I crept downstairs to catch Trix.  The air made my way up soundless and far more stable than using the actual stairs.

I followed him on the second floor scaffolding.  It was never meant to be permanent but like many things it was convenient enough and was left intact.

Ye Pan went into a locked room by punching a code in the keypad.  I watched him hitting the numbers on the pad.  Unlike Dorian I didn't remember everything I saw, but I absorbed patterns and the code for entry was just that a pattern.  I smiled to myself as he walked through the closed door.  I wouldn't make it to the door before it closed, but I didn't have to.  I wove a thin strip of air to keep the door from shutting and walked to it without making a sound.  It wasn't nearly as easy as it sounded as the scaffolding creaked and sputtered under any weight.

I widened my veil to hide the door before I opened it.  Everyone saw what they expected to see, nothing, but the door closed.

I walked through and dropped the veil outside and retained my personal one.  The hallway lead into the depths of the warehouse.  There was a slight hum of machinery below my feet that vibrated through the floor.  I could feel the hum in my bones.  I didn't know what was going on here, I didn't care.  But I had to find out what Ye Pan was doing and take him down. I'd prefer to take him in but I didn't think he'd come quietly, the big bads never did.

I followed him through into wide open room where Ye Pan sat on a throne, an honest to fucking god throne. It was gilded in gold and bore red velvet cushions with red rubies I could guarantee weren't fake.  He sat looking at me through the veil.  "I can see you, Venatori."

I let the veil drop.   He laughed.  "A little more colorful than I expected."  He waved a hand and a small breeze combed through my dyed tips of my hair and brushed against my skin.  "But as the rumor tree goes, I'm glad it's you and not another with your dragon armor bullets.  You rely on  your our magic too much young one."

Ye Pan's accent was thick with his native tongue.  It almost felt exaggerated, like he was mocking his own kind.  Maybe he was.  Many of the older beings lost their accents to blend into whatever society they felt was necessary of the time.  I knew Cari and Ant both had whereas Tony and Francesco still held their native accent when speaking English.

"I am what I am.  I don't assume you will come with me without a fight."  I said.

Pan laughed again.  "I do believe you are correct, my dear boy."  Ye Pan stood up, and I felt more than saw the dragon claws form on his hand.  The pull of the beast beckoning me forth with one crock of his clawed talon.  I'd never seen a dragon powerful enough to shift a single body part.  

The smile on Pan's face faded when I didn't come closer.  His eyes shifted to their green reptile color, and he bled more power into the room.  It felt like I was drowning in the room.  "Come."  He said.  I felt the pull and as much as I tried to stay in place I could not.  It was like I was on puppet strings.  One foot forced itself forward, then the second, each one a fight before I fell to my knees to impede my movement.

Ye Pan laughed.  "You are too willful."  The power from The Dragon bled from every pore in his body, green and bronze scales covered his skin as he let loose the power of the dragon and he lowered his hand and my body bowed beneath the implied crushing movement.  I was helpless to the power.  Dragon blood ran through my veins.  It was not an untruth but he shouldn't have power over me.  I knew this, andÂ I fought with this power.  I would not be cowed by anyone.  Well, that wasn't the truth.  I knew one person I would bend for each time he asked, every time he asked.

I relaxed under the knowledge that this meant nothing.  I let The Dragon's power flow around me - through me and I thought of the strength I had on my own.

The power poured through me as a gun shot rang in the surrounding emptiness.  I looked up and saw a single bullet floating in front of Ye Pan.  His face turnedÂ towards the window. Walker stood with a small team of other Venatori.  My father was among them.  I could feel their power among the others around me.

Ye Pan laughed, and he turned to me.  "Take care of your friends."  With a further crushing weight he pressed his power into me.  I stood not of my free will.  The Dragon's power wielded my body like a weapon, Â a puppet to be aimed at the others.

The others gasped and I saw the look of horror on my father's face.  I cringed inside as I formed a fireball that I had no control over. Â The patterns bent and shaped while I fought against each thread of fire and air.  I closed my eyes and focused on the blue eyes I'd fallen so deeply in love with so quickly.  

I opened my eyes and watched as the fireball flew towards my father and my partner.  They were jumping to the sides and over the railing to avoid the collision with the flames.  It splattered against a wall of air. Â The Dragon controlled me but I had enough will to do more than his bidding.Â 

I felt my power rip away, and the wall fell seconds after the fireball hit.  I smiled at Ye Pan.  He bent me in half, crushing me against the ground again.  "If you will not obey."

I couldn't see anything with my face pressed to the cold concrete, but I didn't need to see.  I let my sense go.  I felt everything, saw everything with the patterns of energy.  I could feel my father through the floor he stood on.  I could see the air that Walker breathed.  Dorian's father was still on the scaffolding a distance from where he'd started, I knew from the connection to the floor that his gun was aimed at me.  Dragon piercing bullets would kill me the same as The Dragon.

I felt Ye Pan's wrath being wielded against my partner and father and the fourth Venatori who'd joined them.  A woman I didn't know.  A woman I wouldn't ever know as the fire that encased her was burning her alive before I could react.

I pressed my fingers into the concrete below and pushed earth and air and fire into the ground in front of me.  The floor jutted up, and the room shook under the strain of earth erupting through the beams.  Fire sprung from beneath and the air pushed it towards The Dragon.  

He turned as the first wave encompassed him.  The first wave removed his hold over me.  I stood up feeling his power trying to take my head again.  I smiled at him.  "I'm not a dragon, Ye Pan.  I. Am. Venatori."

He looked at me with wide eyes as his cage of earth formed around him pinning him to the ground.  I stood over him while he tried to weave pattern after pattern at me.  I silenced them with ease.  Seeing the pattern was only the start of it, knowing how to undo it was always the fun part.  I smiled at him.  Fireball countered by air and water as it formed.   Bonds of air sliced by earth as they tried to wrap around my body.  I drew Damnation from her home at my waist and I pointed it at Ye Pan.  "One last chance, will you come peacefully?"

The Dragon spat at my shoes in front of him.  "That's what I thought."  I removed the safety and squeezed the trigger and put a single dragon piercing round into his forehead. 

I pulled the fire alarm with a weave of air as I set Ye Pan's body on fire with a weave.  It would burn until it and everything in the building was cinder. And then and only then would the magic fade and let the flames die.  There would be nothing left of this operation.  I didn't know what it was.  I didn't care.  The Venatori evacuated everyone as I sat on the end of the docking bay while the building burned around them. I Â controlled the flames until every last soul, supernatural or otherwise, was clear.

Walker came up and put his hand on my shoulder. "Everyone's out."

I jumped off the platform with a kick of my legs and landed with a soft jar to my knees before I turned around and let the flames go, setting the magical barrier that would let it all burn to the ground damaging no other property.

We walked away in silence.  My father and Emilio waited at the end of the alleyway for us.  They would carry the bad news to the woman who had passed in The Dragon's fire.  Emilio and Walker refused to let Kai tell me her name.  Emilio making him promise to not tell me.

It didn't matter either way.  I would find out her name.  When we joined Walker and Emilio pulled ahead of my father and I.Â 

Kai watched me as we walked.  Emilio and Walker went down the stairs to the subway station I didn't feel like joining them, but I was surprised when my father kept walking with me.  We walked two additional blocks in silence until Kai broke it.  "I didn't know you had it in you."

"Know I had what in me?" I asked.

"To pull the trigger on a man."  Kai said.  I could hear the concern in his voice.  "What did he do to you?"

"He controlled me.  What did it look like?"  I said, my voice dripped with sarcasm.

"How?"

"Dragon Blood."  

"That should be weak inside of you - half human and all. He couldn't control me."

I sighed.  "I'm Cesari you are not.  You can't bend all four elements."

Kai nodded.  "Still, you shouldn't go up against dragons again until we explore it."

"Whatever."  I moved forward at a faster pace but my father kept paceÂ with ease.  So I stopped instead.  My father followed suit a few paces ahead of me.  He turned to look at me.  I asked him, "You aren't great at this are you?"

"Good at what?" My father returned the question.

"At pretending you care."

Kai closed the few paces between us and I took an involuntary step backwards as my father stepped into my personal space.  He'd backed me up against the wall and held his finger in front of me to scold me. I stared back with a look of defiance etched on my features, but I couldÂ the fear in my pulse rise as he did it.  But he didn't scare me, not in my rational mind.  But my mind was never rational.  I felt like the child I had been before I knew Kai Viddens was my father.  I felt five with Garrett standing over me wielding the same finger and the fury of his hidden powers with them.  The intensity of the lessons that day would be worse.  Flashes of my nightmares floated before my eyes.

I don't know what my father saw on my face but his face softened as he took a step back and lowered his hand.  "Who the fuck messed you up?"

I knew I should answer him or face his wrath but my mouth was dry I couldn't speak even if I wanted to.  I felt lost, even more so than before.  All control was gone.  My father could manipulate me like The Dragon except it was my fear, my memories that paralyzed my body from doing what I wanted it to do.  "Those scars on your back.  They aren't just you were they?"

I shook my head.  "I used to hide them."

"Why don't you now?"  Kai asked his voice was softer now. 

"No point.  Too much work.  I'm notÂ required to disrobe in front of strangers.  And I forget now I should when in the gym."

Kai asked, "You okay?"

"No.  I need to go home."  It was the truth.  All I wanted was to curl up in my bed and cry.  But I wouldn't tell that to my absentee father.

"Let's go then.  We will take the next train."  Kai glanced at his watch and then reached for my shoulder which I pulled away from immediate.  Kai dropped his hand to his sides.  "Let's go, son.  I'll make sure you make it to your apartment.  Do you need me to tell someone?"

I only shrugged as we walked.  I wanted Sage to be there.  But I wasn'y about to put this on him. The next station was only half a block away and as we were going down I whispered, "Can you make sure Drake has a place to stay tonight?"

Kai nodded.  "He can stay with me.  Unlike most of my children you grant me that privilege occasionally."

I gave my father a weak smile.  "Don't try to be a good father.  Be a great grandfather for him.  You and me, we'll work on it through him."

Kai laughed.  "That's exactly what Margo said."

I gave him a genuine smile.  "She's a smart woman."



# In the End

The rest of the way home was quiet.  My father made sure I made it inside my apartment.  He didn't go past the hall.  "I'll take care of Drake.  You take care of you."

I nodded and closed the door behind me.  I didn't lock it, locking it meant having to get up out of bed when I didn't want to.  I kicked off my shoes into the corner by the door.  Placed my keys in the bowl on the bar and then pulled my hoodie off.  I shed everything but my boxers on my way to my bed in the dark.  My phone held tightly in my hands as I curled under my blankets.

I looked at my phone ignoring anythingÂ there except to pull up Sage's contact. 

> Me  
> 646-555-4512  
> Tue, 06/26/2015  
> ****  
> I'm home.  In bed.  
> 8:32 PM  

I tucked my phone under my hand as I curled around my pillow and closed my eyes.  I could still see the power of The Dragon.  I could still feel the call of it coursing through my body.  Green glowing eyes floated in front of me, crushing me to the ground.

My phone chirped at me bringing me back from the depths of the darkness I had descended.

I opened my eyes and looked at the message.

> Mysterious blue-eyed boy

> 8:33 PM  

I drifted off into the depths of the darkness again.  The glowing green eyes and the suffocating power encompassed by the weight of an unseen force pressing into my body.  I jumped when I felt the cool touch of long fingers on my arm.  I jerked away from the touch and I heard a loud thump on the floor.

I flipped on the light with flick of air and saw a beautiful blue eyed face staring back at me rubbing his head.  He smiled shyly from the floor.  "I should have woke you up first."

I couldn't speak as I was trying to catch my breath and calm my rapidly beating heart.  I held out my hand to him and invited Sage into my bed.  He'd already removed clothing and was wearing only a pair of boxers.  I pulled him close and let him wrap his arms around me.  I laid my head on his chest and said nothing as I curled around him.  I felt childish, like the five-year-old my father had resurrected curling around a worn out old dragon who had been my best friend.  I whispered, "I'm sorry I'm a broken mess."

Sage chuckled as he pulled me closer and rubbed my naked back. "You are my broken mess." I tensed against him, but he continued to rub gentle circles against my back and hummed softly in my ear and kissed the top of my head.  "Give me your phone," he instructed.  I slide it to his chest from the place I'd held it between us.  "I will silence it and put it here."  I didn't look to see where he did only nodded.  "Now go to sleep."

My body relaxed as Sage held me.  The monotony of the circles on my back madeÂ my eyes closed and I listened to the beat of Sage's heart below my ear.  I let the touch of his fingers, the sound of his voice in my ear, and the rhythm of his heart take me deep down into sleep.

A gentle hand on my shoulder and a soft voice in my ear woke me.  I couldn't make out the words.  There was a gentle shake, and I grumbled under my breath.  The voice laughed in my ear.  The sound sending shivers down my spine which made open my eyes and look up at the face staring down at me.  "Hmmm?"  I said putting my head back on Sage's shoulder and closing my eyes again.

Sage kissed the top of my head before he spoke in my ear.  "You need to get up."

"Why?"  I asked.  I fought down the urge to panic. Sage was calm.  He wouldn't be if things were bad.  I knew he'd key me into the situation.

"The Dragon Council will be here in an hour."  Sage showed me a text on my phone from Dae'lin.

> Boss lady  
> 664-555-4189  
> Wed, 06/26/2015  
> ****  
> Tell him the Dragon Council will be here at 9:00 AM on the dot.  I need him here.  
> 6:15 AM  

I glanced up at the time on the phone and saw it was 8 AM.  I sat up and Sage was staring up at me from where he'd remained lying in my bed.  "I've been asleep for over ten hours?"

Sage nodded. "Yeah?"  He sounded confused, "Is that a problem?"

I shook my head.  "No.  Just it's never happened before."

Sage smiled.  "You had a rough night."

"You don't understand.  I was having nightmares before you came to my bed last night.  Even in the half sleep between text messages.  You are here.  I didn't wake up.  My nightmares didn't show up.  Sage.  They never do that.  I always have a nightmare.  I always wake up in 6 hours. Always."

Sage sat up and kissed my cheek.  "Well.  You can deal with that later.  Right now you need a shower, and I'll go downstairs and grab breakfast so you won't be late to the meeting with the Dragon Council."

I nodded and got out of bed with little more discussion.  Sage chuckled at me.  "Is this going to be a common occurrence?"

I looked back at him in confusion.  "What?"

"You doing what I say when I say it?"  He grinned up at me from the bed.  He purposefully stretched elongating every muscle in his body making sure I saw him do it too.  "You've been doing it all night.  Even in your sleep.  You'd roll away, and you'd whimper.  I'd pull you back and whisper for you to relax and you would.  I think I spent most of my night subconsciously comforting you. I'm surprisingly well rested for keeping you relaxed."

I smiled and walked over to the lounging cat that was my boyfriend trying to entice me with his languid body.  "It's what I need."  I kissed him on the lips.  "We can talk about that late,r too.  I need to take a shower."

Sage laughed.  "You do."  Sage got up and pulled on his jeans.  "I'll get breakfast and coffee."

"At least make coffee here.  The stuff downstairs is horrible."  I pleaded.

Sage nodded.  "I can do that.  Can't be that hard."

I leveled a gaze at him and frowned.  He grinned.  "I can't cook.  I burn water."

I shuddered and left my boyfriend to get dressed while I ran the shower as hot as I could stand. My mind glided over the past night, remembering the events as if there were happening to someone else.  Like I'd watched it all happen.  

I'd known what was going on despite the battle for my self.  I heard the Venatori crash through the windows of the warehouse once Ye Pan had crushed my body with his power.  My father had toÂ feel the power.  

I remember looking up just in time to watch the muzzle flash of my father's gun go off.  He'd fired at Ye Pan and I watched it travel through the air.  The power of the dragon before me slowed it.  The air around it solidified until it stood feet away from him hanging in mid air.  

And then his command puppeted me towards my father and the others. Walker among them.  There was a knock at the bathroom door but Sage didn't wait for me to say anything as he stepped inside closing the door behind him.  "You okay?  You won't have enough time to eat."

I nodded.  "I'd gotten lost in the memory.  That wasn't good."  I turned off the water and grabbed the towel that hung inside and dried off before stepping out into the cool air of my bathroom.  Sage set clothes down on the counter. 

Sage smiled.  "Get dressed.  Hurry so you can at least eat something."

The door opened, and I smelled coffee and I did as Sage instructed.  I didn't think it was his suggestion more than the desire for coffee.  But I had a feeling just letting Sage run the show for now was why I wasn't panicking about sleeping in, about not hearing my text messages go off.  By the lost memories.  There was much to trouble my mind.  But Sage took care of it, took care of me.  I smiled as I applied the eye liner and then stepped out of my bathroom ready for the rest of my day.

Sage grinned.  "I like that shirt."

I had paid no attention to what he'd chosen for me.  I looked down to see the skeleton climbing out of a rib cage with the fires of hell behind it.  It was one of the few long sleeved t-shirts I owned.  I chuckled at the irony.  "That's how I feel today."  I wrapped my arms around him and kissed his neck and whispered in his ear, "Thanks to you."

Sage laughed and pulled me to sit next to him.  "Eat.  I did nothing, Nox.  I was just here."

"You have no idea what you did, Sage.  But you did more than just be in this room with me."  I opened the Styrofoam box that Sage had brought and found a large omelet of roasted vegetables and sausage.  I looked at him, "You ordered ahead?"

He laughed.  "I did.  Apparently Ms. Shelia caters to a lovely young man who likes to cook with her."  He ate a few spoonfuls of his own oatmeal.  "I think she has a crush on you."

I grinned at him.  "Why wouldn't she?"  I ate a few bites of my omelet before I added.  "She kept me fed during some pretty rough times when bullies decided I shouldn't eat for a week of breakfasts in a row."

Sage wrapped his arm around him.  "We'll I'll make sure the bullies leave you alone now."

I laughed.  "I don't have to play nice now.  The last time Aaron decided my breakfast belonged on the floor and I was a punching bag, he got in one good shot before he was lying on the floor choking. He ran away with his tail between his legs.  Him and his buddies.  I think that had more to do with Walker than me but I'll take it."

"My boyfriend, the big bully."  Sage laughed.

I stuck my tongue out at him.  

Sage raised his eyebrow at my action.  "You remember what I said about that."

I grinned at him.  "I do."

"I don't think it's quite the reprimand it should be."  Sage grinned.

"I'm okay with that."

Sage shook his head and finished his breakfast and his coffee before he swiveled in his stool and watched me eat my food.

When I put the last of my omelet into my mouth Sage turned me in my bar stool, my knees were on the outside of his.  Sage stood up and put his hands on my shoulder.  "Stick it out again."

I gave him a look of defiance but I obeyed after a moment.  I stuck my tongue out him even more childishly than before.  Sage chuckled before he put his lips around it and sucked on it.  It tightened things below my belt.  I hummed in pleasure and Sage bit and my eyes opened wide in surprise.  He chuckled against my lips as he let go and licked my lips.  "You always taste good."

I laughed.  "I try."

"We should go.  I'll walk you downstairs.  You gonna be okay?"

I nodded.  "Yeah, I'll be fine.  Thank you for your help."

Sage pulled away.  "There will come a point when you need to take control back, you know?"

I nodded.  "Soon as we walk out the door.  I'll be the adult I'm supposed to be.  If that's all right with you."

Sage laughed.  "Let's go.  I can be whatever you need, whenever you need it, Nox."

I joined Sage and pulled him against me.  "I'll be whatever you need me to be, too.  Just let me know what that is."

Sage grinned.  "We are doing pretty good, I think."

I kissed him in agreement.  His lips were soft and warm and I wanted nothing more than to stay here in his arms but the Dragon Council wouldn't wait on me.  I broke the kiss and smiled at him.  I was so far down the rabbit hole there was no coming back up.  I only hoped I didn't scare him away. There was no I could handle it.

I stepped out from between the bar stools and grabbed my phone and keys.  Sage was already standing in the open doorway leading into the hall waiting on me.  "I'll go check on Drake.  Make sure he gets to school on time.  I like your father.  He's good with Drake.  The three of us spent time together while you were out doing your thing."

I took a deep breath and tried not to sound angry.  I'd wished Dae'lin had stayed out of it.  But family was important to Sage - more so than the family I wanted to have - he wanted everyone to be happy which included my relationship with my father.  Sage must have gathered my thoughts because he took my hand in his and squeezed.  "I know you are trying.  He knows too."  He smiled at me.  "Did you know he has a standing monthly appointment with Dr. Silverman to discuss you."

I shook my head.  "I'm sure it's just an excuse to take her out for lunch."

Sage shook his head.  "He said you'd say that.  But he said it was in her office.  Officially recorded.  And the discussion notes are in your files if you ever wanted to know what they said about you."

"I know.  I've skipped past them.  I don't want to know what other people tell Margo.  If it's important enough for me to know she tells me.  And if it's not, then whatever they are trying to do to help I see in the real world."

Sage grinned.  "So if I spoke to Dr. Silverman about you, you'd not read it."

I stopped in the hallway and looked at him.  "I'd....No."  I shook my head.  "I wouldn't read it.  I don't plan on keeping things from you.  But I'm difficult to live with.  You can ask Jace or Dorian and even Dae'lin.  I don't want to know when you need to vent because I've been a dick, or I said something I didn't mean.  Or because you are just plain fed up with how I react to stress.  I can't say it's not tempting because it is.  To know what someone feels about me for real in their own words unfiltered by my needs it's comforting and scary all at the same time. We'll work this through.  If it doesn't work out, I don't want to know all the ways I fucked up."

Sage sighed and walked pulling me along with him. "I think that's the hardest part in all of this.  You are the first person to put yourself down."

"Years of practice."  I said.  

Sage stopped and pushed me up against the wall pinning my shoulders to it.  My pulse quickened and I could feel my pores dripping with sweat.  I swallowed hard, and I saw the look of concern deepen as he saw the fear coursing through my body.  He shook his head and then kissed me deeply.  He pushed me further into the wall.  If he'd had super human strength, the dry wall would be damaged.  But Sage was just human. A human with human magic but still just human.  

He pressed his body against mine and he framed my head with his forearms against the wall.  I had no choice but to look into those big blue eyes of his.  I saw sorrow and hope, happiness and despair.  Sage was conflicted.  "I need you to do two things for me."

I nodded.  And Sage continued.  "You won't say anything bad about yourself.  I don't even want you to think it."

I sighed and dropped my gaze from his eyes.  I gave him a slight nod before he continued.  "You won't let anyone step all over you.  That includes yourself."

My eyes flicked up to meet his as I asked, "What do you expect me to do?"

"Stand up for yourself.  You aren't a child anymore, Nox.  No one treats you like dirt.  You have the ear of the most powerful vampire in the world.  You beat one of the oldest dragons.  Not only did you beat him, Nox, you over threw his control of you."

"Who told you that?"

"I saw it all happen.  Walker and the others all had video feeds."

I felt deflated.  I saw the memories floating out.  The weakness of my mind - the control that had been taken from me.  Sage kissed me hard and brought me back from them.  "No."  Sage bit out in a cold white heat I hadn't expected from him.  "You don't beat yourself up.  There is nothing wrong with you.  Shit happens.  It wasn't your fault."

Sage pulled away from me and took my hand in his and pulled me towards the elevator and down to the conference room level.  He got off the glass death trap with me and turned me towards him and dusted off my shoulders as if I had something on them, straightened a fake tie at my neck and kissed my cheek.  "Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."

I couldn't help but smile at his joke. "Casablanca."  I grinned.

"You've seen that?"  Sage asked.

I shook my head.  "No but I know Humphrey Bogart when I hear it."

Sage grinned.  "We'll have to watch it together one day - soon."

I nodded, "Any time with you is well spent.  Thank you, Sage."  Three little words sat at the tip of my tongue and I held them back.  I wasn't ready to utter them and I was certain Sage wasn't ready to hear them.

He smiled at me and pushed me off toward the large conference room.  "Good luck," he called out after me.

I turned and waved and then found myself in an empty conference room.  But it was set up for dignitaries and here I was in jeans and a t-shirt.  Oh well, I thought.  I took a seat on the side of the large conference room table while I waited for others to arrive.

The door opened to the conference room and a small black man came into the room.  I could see the small dragon shadow behind him and stood up.  He smiled.  "Sit, Mr. SÃ©tanta.  I'm only making preparations for The Council."

"Do you need help?" I asked.

He shook his head.  "No sir, security and all that.  We trust you are as unarmed as you come?"

I grinned.  "Yes, sir.  My only weapon is my ability."

"As is ours.Â We appreciate it."

I laughed, "Except some of you can apparently control Magnus, and others of you can just eat us whole.   So it's perfectly acceptable."

The black man smiled.  His dark brown eyes light with humor I thanked the heavens for a sense of humor.  "Yes, you are right.  Perhaps we should inform you that there is not a representative here from the Council that has The Dragon's ability.  Only the oldest of us could tame the beasts inside of you."

"Do you mean that others here wouldn't be a challenge?"  I asked.

"Yes, Mr. SÃ©tanta.  The leader of your Venatori will not risk meeting with any of the older dragons."

"Nox, please. Are any in New York, the oldest of you?"  I asked.

"Of course... Nox."  He gave me a wary glance before continuing.  "Reginald Pittman is always in New York.  Why do you ask?"

I smiled.  "Why isn't he joining us then?"

"Your leader will not permit him on your property."

"I'd like to meet him.  Can that be arranged?" I asked.

"Of course, sir.  I can have him here with the others if itÂ is to your liking."  He stated.

"Why would you do that for me?"  

He only smiled and pulled his phone from his breast coat wallet.  "Alexandra.  Mr. Pittman's presence has been requested at Apex Unlimited."  He paused while he listened to the other end.  I could have listened, but I didn't, there was no need and I didn't care.

"Yes, Alexandra.  The area is secure and there is no danger.  The Venatori have agreed we are not in danger, nor are they."  I could hear a frantic voice on the other side.  He interrupted. "I assure Mr. Pittman that Mr. Green will not follow through with his threats.  It is in his best interests to allow this meeting."

A few more moments of silence from my black friend and he hung up the phone.  "Mr. Pittman will join us with the rest of the contingent.  Would you like to add a person to the parlay?"

"I didn't know we were parlaying.  I think we are good."  I stood up and offered my hand to the man.  "What should I call you?"

"My name is Marcus, sir."  He took my hand and there was a strange feeling of power struck between us.  I don't think I'd ever been this close to a dragon who wasn't trying to kill me before. Â Which wasn't necessarily true, my Nanny had been a dragon, but she was just a faded memory of a baby. Â 

Marcus smiled at me.  "Is there anything I can get you?"

"No.  You are our guest, are you not?  Shouldn't I be asking you that?"

Marcus laughed.  "Perhaps.  But sit.  I will have water delivered and maybe some refreshments.  I think everyone else is about to arrive, anyway."  He tapped the security comms in his ear.

I nodded.  "I'm underdressed aren't I?"

Marcus laughed again.  "Sir, you are dressed exactly how everyone expects you to be."

"I don't know if that's a compliment or an insult."  I sat down and waited.

Marcus moved to the door and stopped with a grin.  "It is merely a statement of fact, sir.  No one expects anything of you."

I sighed.  "Now that is an insult."

Marcus frowned.  "It wasn't meant as such, sir.  Please excuse me while I finish my rounds before the others arrive."

I nodded and turned back towards the table wondering what had just happened.  Why would anyone counter Mark Green's words over mine?  I knew why I'd made the request, a lot of it had to do with Sage's last instructions.  And to prove to myself I would not let myself be controlled again like that.  

I was pulled out of my revelry when the large double doors opened to the conference room.  Dae'lin and Gary entered with Mark Green.  Walker, my father and Emilio followed them in and took up a post at the end of the wall while the other two sat down.  Dae'lin smiled when she saw me.  "Sit down, Nox."

I wanted to stick my tongue out at her but I didn't.  Walker chuckled to himself against the wall.  My father and Emilio gave him a sideways glance, and he clamped his mouth shut.

Mark Green took up his station at the head of the table in front of the three standing Venatori.  Dae'lin and Gary to each side.  Dae'lin sat next to me for which I was grateful.

Our leader was a balding man in his late 60s who was the oldest living Cesari.  He had made his name helping Asher Eriksen run Apex Unlimited.  But his pattern was weak.  He was NC5 but I could feel it was barely on the cusp of it.  I let my senses flow.  I saw the patterns around Dae'lin fluctuate with her ability.  Fire, Air, Earth, Water oscillated in and out of her like they were fighting to take control, but fire was brightest.  She had been a fire-starter.  But everyone in her family was, her control was scant, but she had controlled it early and hadn't undergone the same lessons I had.

The Dragon Council contingent was three men and one woman.  I recognized Marcus, but he was the weakest of the bunch.  He was first and lead the way to their side of the table.  The woman was next.  Marcus pulled the chair out for the woman with the ruby red hair.  Her dragon shadow was ruby colored.  I could almost make out the individual scales on her.  I smiled as she sat down next to me. 

Across from me, a man with blue eyes sat down.  His suit matched his eyes, and the dragon shadow behind him was the same color.  I felt power dripping from him.  But he was not holding back.  None of them were as far as I could tell.

A man with graying wispy hair followed them in.  His skin was touched with golden hues that were not normal.  I smiled and stood as he took his seat.  "Mr. Pittman, it's an honor to meet you."  I gave him a slight bow before retaking my seat.

The golden man chuckled.  "You can tell who I am by just looking at me?"

I smiled.  "You radiate power. The dragon shadow is larger than the others here.  And you are the only one who's shields are tightly locked down.  I can't see the color of your dragon, but I can guess you are a Golden Dragon.  Exquisite and extremely rare, hunted by humans and other races a like for their precious scales, almost to the point of extinction."

"You know a lot about dragons for one so young."  Mr. Pittman said.

"I take pride in knowing everything I can about the creatures I'm charged with bringing in."

"An interesting phrasing.  Most of your kind just kill."

I laughed.  "You must not have heard of me then."

"Oh, Mr. SÃ©tanta.  I have heard of you.  Ilesha speaks highly of the boy she was asked to raise."

"You know my nanny from when I was a baby?"  I asked.

"You think it odd, that your nanny was a dragon?  For a Venatori human mother?"

"I was five when I last saw her.  I didn't think beyond that."

The old dragon smiled, and it was not a human smile, sharp pointed teeth shown through.  His own protections must be weakening.  He waved his hand and the double doors opened and Dr. Margo Silverman walked through my door.  Mr. Pittman spoke from the end of his table.  "Nox.  I would like to like to introduce you to Ilesha."

I wasn't the only one staring at my therapist.  But it was only Kai who gasped with the knowledge he'd been sleeping with a dragon.  The shield around Margo evaporated and the surrounding shadow opened into a golden dragon half the size of Mr. Pittman's.  I turned to look at him and saw the familial resemblance.  "Your daughter? Is she really a therapist?"

"I am, Nox.  It's been a struggle to keep the fact from you for so long.  You grow in power every day.  Your schedule with me is something even I need to rely on.  Shielding that tightly costs me."  Margo said.  She knelt down next to me and looked up at me.  "I am still the same person."

I asked, "Why lie to me?"

Mr. Pittman answered.  "The dragons felt your presence come into the world in Boulder.  That was when Ilesha went to your mother and offered her services as a Nanny.  We sense any dragon born into the world - your young Drake here in the building - we knew of his birth."

I stood up but Margo's hand on my knee stayed me.  "Drake will not be harmed.  It is your will."

"I'm not a dragon."

Margo smiled.  "No, Nox.  You are Cesari.  The dragon's feel your kind like our own.  Dragons born with human blood."

"I am still not a dragon."  

Mark Green sighed. "All Magnus are of dragon's blood, Nox.  You know this. You have reminded us of this fact frequently.  Every dragon you bring in.  Every vampire and every were.  Every creature has a history and a life.  You remind us everyday we shouldn't just kill first when the laws are broken."

I sneered, "Yet we still do it."

Mark nodded.  "We are not so easily changed."

I rolled my eyes and turned to the Dragon Council.  "One of your own tried to take down humanity's economic and power infrastructure.  He's dead now."

Mr. Pittman nodded. "We are aware of the passing of The Dragon.  The power loss is surmountable.  It is my understanding he called you."

"He made me his puppet, yes."

Margo's hand squeezed my knee, but I didn't turn to look at her.  I wasn't sure I trusted her now.  All the lies that I'd been told in my life and she kept a big one.  I would deal with it later.  Right now there were other things my plate.

"And you broke his control?"  He smiled. "I'm highly impressed.  Few could do that."

"Why are you watching me?"  I asked.

"We watch all dragons born to humans."

"You kill them all."  I said.

He frowned.  "That is an old tradition.  We like to think ourselves a little more civilized than your kind, but sadly yes, that is usually the case."

"So why is Drake still alive then if you knew about him?"

"There is a method to the tradition.  Each child born must be killed in succession.  For the past 23 years, half dragon and Cesari have been allowed to survive."

"You've been killing Cesari?"  I asked.

Margo frowned.  "As much as the Venatori infiltrate the world, everyone else infiltrates the Venatori.  The answer is yes, Nox.  There are dragons among the nurses who watch for babies of the dragon."

"So why did you let me live?" I asked her.  "You weren't sent to be my nurse maid were you?"

She shook her head.  "No, Nox I wasn't."

"So why am I alive?"  I looked at her.  "Why didn't you kill me as baby?"

Mr. Pittman spoke, "She..."

"No, sir."  I looked at him.  "I want to hear it from her mouth."  I turned back to my therapist, "I want to hear Margo tell me why she didn't kill me."

She stood up and backed away from me.  Her face was ashen.  Her usual bright green eyes were lost in the clouds of memory dulling them completely.  "When I found you, there were two of you.  A girl and a boy.  The first was easily smothered in her slumbers.  Air sucked from her lungs - painless.  The second child, felt the loss of his sibling and protected himself.  I could not get to him.  I tried everything.  That was when I went to your mother and asked to be her nanny.  When she handed you to me, I couldn't do it anymore.  And I'm glad I didn't."

I stared blankly in front of me as she told the story of my birth or rather the death of my sister.  Margo whispered, "Nox.  I think of that day and I regret it every moment."

I held up my hand with one finger to silence her and her sentence cut short.  I stood up and looked at Mr. Pittman.  "Will you retaliate against what I did to The Dragon?"  I felt my power flair with the question.

He shook his head. "No, young one.  Even by Dragon law, he overstepped his bounds."

"And Drake?" I asked.

"He is in the right hands."  Mr Pittman said.  "No one will harm him."

"And as long as I live no half dragons can die?"

The man nodded. "That is correct."

"I'm done here."  I walked out of the conference room but Margo grabbed my arm.  She said something, but I gave her a level gaze and her hand dropped from my arm and she looked to the ground.  

I walked the halls and stair wells for what had to be hours.  My stomach was the one thing that pulled me back to reality.  I couldn't fathom how much of my life had been a lie.  One lie after another.  I felt my power leaking from me and I knew I had to vent some of it before it became dangerous to myself - not to others.  I had since lost the capability to lose control.  But holding that much power at bay that wanted to escape was dangerous to myself.

I should have gone to get food but instead I found myself in the Academy behind an orange door.  The room was similar to every other one in the Academy, used to train students with fire without burning the place down.  The room was coated in fire retardant material and the sprinkler systems were set to a different than the rest of the building.  

It was the one place I could let go of my power and not hurt anyone. Walking into this room caused paralyzing fear, today I wanted to drop to the floor and lose control.  

I didn't drop to the floor, and I didn't lose control.  The door locked into place with the in use sign outside.  I let my power flair.  The fire in the room, it was everywhere.  It always was.  The heat from the sun powering its essence.  I pushed it away and the room lit into a small inferno.  I stood in the center as the fire ran up the walls and across the ceiling.  Crawling like I wanted to.  A storm cloud formed above me and the rain fell drenching my body in the warm drops of water.  A small breeze cooled the water further as it sped up around me.  Earth was never fun, but it circulated through the air with the other elements helping to power and fuel the others.  I could feel the life in the elements.  I let them swirl and combine and make patterns all of their own accord.  

It was a beautiful cacophony of colors and I felt better as the winds died down.  The fire started to spluttered out and the rain slowed.  The earth settled to the ground and soon there was nothing but me standing in the room alone staring at the far wall with tears running down my cheeks.

A voice crackled over the intercom.  "Nox.  You okay?"

I turned to the window above the room that let others look down upon the training and I saw the face of my angel - my Wicked Truth and I frowned.  "No, but I'll be okay.  I'm done.  I'll meet you outside."

I unlocked the door and stepped outside into the cool air-conditioned hall.  The special room had become a sauna of my creation.  Sage was downstairs in a heart beat with a small child holding to his hand and two bags of things with him.  He smiled.  "Dorian told me to take you away from all of this for a few weeks."

"A few weeks?"

Dorian stepped out of the stair well.  "You've got a lot to think about I think.  Your father told me what happened.  I found Sage with Drake and figured it was best he take the two of you away.  Everything will be as you left it when you return.  Take a vacation.  I think Dae'lin will agree.  Learning your father is alive and well is one thing.  Learning your motherly figure all your life killed ..."  

I placed a finger to Dorian's mouth.  "Enough.  I'll go.  Do you have Sage's address?"

Dorian nodded. "Yes. Why?"

"I'd like Jace, Mia and Naya to meet him.  If you could arrange with Sage a time to have them over.  I'll cook. Maybe you and Aiden can come play with Drake too."

Dorian nodded.  "Sounds like a plan. I will let Sage take you home, and we'll talk tomorrow when he drops Drake off for class."  He looked at me sternly.  "You, young man, are not to step foot in this building until at least July 6th.  Do you understand me?"

I nodded.  "Yes, sir."

Dorian smiled at me then patted Sage on the shoulder.  "He's all your's.  Take care of him."

Sage knelt down and whispered in Drake's ear.  I heard him tell Drake to offer me his hand, and we'd swing him.  Drake followed his instructions by holding up his hand and smiling at me.  I took his hand gratefully and smiled down at the most beautiful family I could ever hope for.  Everything would be all right.
